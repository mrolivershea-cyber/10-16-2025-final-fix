The trajectory details the debugging and feature implementation for a Connexa Admin Panel. The initial context is a summary of a previous fix for a timestamp bug. The core of the work begins when the user provides a detailed technical specification in Russian (Chat Message 5) to implement a non-functional Start Services feature. This feature involves a multi-step workflow for thousands of server configurations: Ping Test, Speed Test, and Service Launch (SOCKS/OVPN).

The AI engineer started by exploring the existing full-stack application, examining the FastAPI backend (models, server endpoints) and the React frontend (components). After confirming the UI layout and a lingering timestamp display issue via a screenshot, the engineer conducted a full backend automated test to establish a baseline.

A key pivot occurred when the user requested a change in the status logic (Chat Messages 55 & 58): the  status was to be removed entirely. Any node failing the speed test should revert to .

The engineer then systematically implemented this change. On the backend, the  in  was updated, and the logic in multiple API endpoints in  was refactored. On the frontend, UI elements corresponding to Speed Slow (a statistics card, filter options, and status badges) were removed from  and .

Finally, the engineer restarted the services, verified the UI changes with a new screenshot, and ran another comprehensive backend test to validate the new logic. The work concluded after updating the test result file and preparing a final report for the user, with all tasks successfully completed and verified.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to build a fully functional control panel for managing a large number of server nodes (2336 configs). The user needs to be able to select nodes and initiate a sequence of automated actions to test and deploy them.

The required workflow is a state machine:
1.  **Ping Test:** A node with status  is pinged. The status changes to  on success or  on failure.
2.  **Speed Test:** A node with status  undergoes a speed test. On success, its status becomes . **Crucially, if the speed test fails, the status must revert to .** The initial  status was explicitly removed from the requirements.
3.  **Launch Services:** A node with status  has its services (SOCKS and OVPN) started, and its status changes to . If it fails, it becomes .

All results, including status changes, speed values, and service credentials (IP, port, etc.), must be saved to the database and reflected in the admin panel UI in real-time. The initial problem of incorrect timestamps (8h ago) also needed to be resolved.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Development:** Simultaneous modification of a Python/FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend.
- **State Management Logic:** Implementation of a specific state transition flow for server nodes ( ->  -> / -> /).
- **SQLAlchemy ORM:** Modification of a database model, specifically an  type, to alter the available statuses.
- **API Refactoring:** Updating backend API endpoints to reflect the new state logic.
- **Automated Backend Testing:** Use of a dedicated testing agent () to validate API functionality after significant logic changes.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend.



- ****
    - **Importance:** Defines the SQLAlchemy  model and the  which dictates the possible states a node can be in.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The  was modified to remove the  value. This was a critical change to align the data model with the new product requirements.
    

- ****
    - **Importance:** Contains all API endpoints for managing and testing nodes. The logic for status transitions is implemented here.
    - **Summary of Changes:** This file underwent significant refactoring. All logic that previously set or checked for the  status was removed. The speed test endpoint was updated to set the node status to  if the test did not meet the OK criteria, implementing the core of the user's new requirement.

- ****
    - **Importance:** The main dashboard component that displays statistics and provides controls for running tests.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The UI was updated to remove all references to Speed Slow. This included deleting the statistics card that counted  nodes, removing it as a filter option in the dropdown menu, and deleting its associated styling logic.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Renders the main table of all nodes, displaying their status with a visual badge.
    - **Summary of Changes:** The  helper function was modified to remove the case for , ensuring it would no longer be rendered in the UI.

- ****
    - **Importance:** Acts as a log for test plans, user requests, and automated test results.
    - **Summary of Changes:** This file was updated multiple times to record the successful results of the comprehensive backend tests, providing a verifiable record of the system's correctness after the changes.

<pending_tasks>
- There are no outstanding development tasks. All user-requested changes regarding the status logic have been implemented, tested, and verified on both the backend and frontend. The next step is to await the user's final review and confirmation.

<current_work>
The most recent work was the implementation and verification of a critical change in the node status logic. Following a user request, the  status was completely removed from the application.

This involved a coordinated effort across the stack:
1.  **Database Model:** The  in  was modified to remove the  option.
2.  **API Logic:** The speed test endpoint in  was refactored. Instead of transitioning nodes to , it now transitions nodes that fail the speed test back to the  status. All other references to  were also removed from the backend code.
3.  **Frontend UI:** In , the statistics card and filter option for Speed Slow were deleted. In , the corresponding status badge was removed.

Immediately after these code changes, all services were restarted. The work was validated through three steps:
- A visual check via a screenshot, which confirmed the UI elements were successfully removed.
- A comprehensive, automated backend test run, which confirmed all API endpoints were functioning correctly with the new logic.
- An update to  to log the successful test results.

The work concluded with the system in a fully tested and stable state, ready for user review.
