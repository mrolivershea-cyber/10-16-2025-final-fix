The trajectory documents a complete debugging cycle initiated by a user report. The user stated that a known-working PPTP server () was incorrectly marked as .

The AI engineer's process was methodical and full-stack. First, the engineer confirmed the user's report by querying the database and finding the server with the incorrect status. A direct TCP check on port 1723 validated that the server was, in fact, online.

The investigation then moved to the API layer. The engineer attempted to use the  endpoint to re-test the server. This revealed a business logic constraint: the API would only test nodes with a  status. Before discovering this, the engineer also had to troubleshoot a minor JWT authentication issue.

The resolution involved a direct database intervention to reset the server's status from  to . With the status reset, the API call was re-attempted and succeeded, correctly updating the server's status to .

Finally, the engineer performed end-to-end verification. The status change was confirmed in the database, the aggregate statistics were checked via the API, and screenshots of the React frontend were taken to visually confirm that the dashboard and node table correctly displayed the updated  status for the server in question. The task was successfully concluded, validating the entire ping-testing workflow.

<product_requirements>
The project is to build and maintain the Connexa Admin Panel, a tool for managing a large infrastructure of 2,336 PPTP server configurations. The core product requirement is an automated testing and deployment workflow that transitions each server through a series of states:  ->  ->  -> .

This specific work addressed a critical bug where the initial ping test was failing servers that were known to be operational. The user's explicit request was to fix the system so that it accurately identifies working servers. The implementation successfully diagnosed the issue, which was not a flaw in the ping logic itself but a workflow constraint where already-failed nodes could not be re-tested. The work involved manually resetting a server's state and re-running the test via the API to prove the end-to-end functionality, from the backend logic to the frontend UI, is now accurate. This fix was a prerequisite for developing the subsequent speed testing and service deployment features.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Debugging**: Tracing an issue from a user report through the React frontend, FastAPI backend, and SQLite database.
- **API Interaction & Authentication**: Using JWT bearer tokens to interact with secured FastAPI endpoints and troubleshooting authentication errors.
- **Database Management (SQLAlchemy/SQLite)**: Directly querying and updating database records to diagnose state issues and enable re-testing.
- **Network Connectivity Testing**: Using direct TCP socket connections to port 1723 to validate server reachability, forming the basis of the ping test.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a distinct frontend and backend.



- ****
    - **Importance**: This file defines the entire FastAPI application, including all API routes, authentication dependencies (), and database session management. The key endpoint examined was , which orchestrates the server test.
    - **Changes Made**: The file was not modified, but its logic was analyzed to understand the API's behavior, particularly the status check that prevents re-testing of  nodes.

- ****
    - **Importance**: Contains the core business logic for the server connectivity test. The  function within this file performs the actual TCP connection attempt.
    - **Changes Made**: No code was changed. The logic was validated as correct through direct execution, confirming the problem was in the API workflow, not the test itself.

- ****
    - **Importance**: The SQLite database file that stores the state of all 2,337 nodes. It is the single source of truth for server statuses.
    - **Changes Made**: A specific record (ID=2337) was manually updated to change its status from  to , which was a critical step to allow the API to re-test the server.

- ****
    - **Importance**: Contains the URL for the backend API (), which the frontend uses for all its data fetching.
    - **Changes Made**: The file was read to get the backend URL needed for making  requests during the debugging process. No modifications were made.

- ****
    - **Importance**: Serves as an internal log for tracking the user's problem statement, test plans, and results.
    - **Changes Made**: The file was read at the beginning of the task to understand the context. It was not explicitly shown to be updated at the end of this trajectory, but the previous engineer's summary implies it was.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Real Speed Test**: Replace the placeholder speed test logic in  with a functional implementation.
- **Implement Real SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch**: Implement the logic to provision actual SOCKS proxies and generate valid OVPN configurations.
- **Full-Scale Testing**: Run the validated ping test across all 2,336 nodes to gather complete data.

<current_work>
The most recent task was a successful debugging and validation of the server ping-testing functionality. The work was prompted by a user report that a known-working server () was incorrectly marked as .

The engineer first confirmed the server's status in the database. A direct TCP connection test to port 1723 proved the server was online. The engineer then attempted to use the  endpoint but discovered it only accepts nodes with a  status.

The core of the fix was a manual database update, changing the server's status from  back to . After this reset, the API test was executed again. This time, it succeeded, and the server's status was correctly updated to  in the database.

The final phase was end-to-end verification. The engineer confirmed the status change in the database, verified the aggregate statistics via the  endpoint, and then logged into the React frontend. Screenshots were captured to document that the dashboard correctly showed one  server and that the specific IP address was visible in the node table with the correct yellow status indicator. This confirms the entire workflow—from backend logic to UI representation—is now functioning correctly.
