The trajectory details a debugging session initiated by a user's bug report, which superseded the planned feature development. The user reported that the server import functionality in the Connexa Admin Panel was critically broken: when importing servers with the ping or ping + speed test options enabled, all servers would either be marked as  or the import process would hang at 90%.

The AI engineer systematically investigated the issue. It started by examining the frontend component () to understand the user flow, then moved to the backend API endpoint ( in ) that handled the logic. The core of the investigation focused on the testing functions being invoked.

The key breakthrough was the discovery that the import endpoint was calling the wrong testing function. It used a generic ICMP ping ( from ) instead of the required, application-specific PPTP connection test ( from ). This explained the incorrect  statuses.

To address the hanging at 90% issue, the engineer correctly identified a lack of timeouts and robust error handling. The fix was twofold:
1.  The incorrect function calls in  were replaced with the correct PPTP testing functions.
2.  The testing logic was wrapped in an  block to implement a 30-second timeout, and error handling was improved to prevent unresponsive nodes from stalling the entire import process.

The fix was successfully validated with the backend testing agent and a visual check of the frontend via screenshots, after which the task was concluded.

<product_requirements>
The Connexa Admin Panel is a web application designed to manage a fleet of PPTP servers. The primary goal is to provide administrators with tools to import, test, and monitor these servers efficiently.

A critical bug was identified in the server import feature. When an administrator used the import modal to add multiple servers and selected a testing mode (ping only or ping + speed), the process would fail in one of two ways:
1.  All imported servers would have their status incorrectly set to , even if they were active.
2.  The import process would stall, appearing to hang at 90% completion, leaving the servers in an indeterminate state.

The immediate requirement was to fix this functionality to ensure that the server import and testing pipeline is reliable. The implemented solution successfully addressed this by correcting the backend testing logic to use the appropriate PPTP-specific test and by adding robust timeout and error handling to prevent the process from hanging. The import feature is now stable and functional.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI:** The backend framework used for creating the API endpoints, including the fixed .
- **Asyncio:** Used for handling concurrent server tests during the import process. The  function was crucial for implementing the timeout fix.
- **PPTP Protocol Testing:** The core of the bug was the distinction between a generic ICMP ping and a specific TCP connection test on the PPTP port (1723), which was the required validation method.
- **React:** The frontend framework used to build the user interface, including the  component that initiated the process.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Real Speed Test**: The current speed test logic in  is a placeholder. A functional implementation that measures and saves actual download/upload speeds needs to be developed.
- **Implement SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch**: The core business logic for provisioning SOCKS and OpenVPN services on the servers is still pending and needs to be implemented.

<current_work>
The most recently completed work was a critical bug fix for the server import functionality. A user reported that importing servers with the ping or ping + speed options enabled would cause all servers to be marked as  or would cause the process to hang at 90%.

The root cause was traced to the backend's import endpoint ( in ). The investigation revealed two distinct issues:
1.  **Incorrect Test Function**: The endpoint was using a generic ICMP ping test from  instead of the required PPTP-specific connection test located in . This resulted in false negatives for all servers.
2.  **No Timeout Handling**: The asynchronous testing loop lacked a timeout mechanism. If a server was unresponsive, the entire import process would stall indefinitely, creating the hang at 90% symptom.

The fix involved modifying  to call the correct  function and wrapping each test in an  block with a 30-second timeout. This ensures tests are accurate and the import process is resilient to failing nodes. The fix was fully tested and validated, and the application's import feature is now stable.

<optional_next_step>
Now that the critical import bug is resolved, the next step is to resume the planned feature development by implementing the real speed test functionality, replacing the current placeholder logic.
