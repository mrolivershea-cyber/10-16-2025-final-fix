The AI engineer's work in this trajectory primarily focused on resolving critical performance issues in the Connexa Admin Panel. Initially, the AI presented a plan, but the user immediately reported persistent UI sluggishness (панель по прежнему долго реагирует). The  was engaged, identifying root causes: inefficient frontend re-renders, lack of debouncing, unoptimized backend queries with , and missing database indexes.

The AI then systematically implemented fixes: frontend debouncing and / in ; backend database indexing in ; and optimized SQL queries in . Critical bugs, including a missing and a duplicated  decorator in , were also identified and corrected.

After iterative debugging and restarts, the AI successfully verified the fixes through screenshots and . The panel now loads quickly, filtering is responsive, Select All performs efficiently, and backend API calls meet performance targets. The task concluded with status updates in .

<product_requirements>
The user requires an enhanced Connexa Admin Panel capable of reliably handling large server import and testing operations without UI freezes or data loss, while providing real-time feedback.
**Initial Problems:** UI freezing at 90% during imports/tests, lack of progress visibility, and blocking modals.
**Initial Requirements:** Real-time progress (processed/total), minimize functionality with  state persistence, and backend batch processing with incremental saves.
**Evolved Requirements (from user feedback):**
1.  Verify real speed test functionality.
2.  Crucially, resolve slow panel loading and UI freezing, particularly for Select All and filter operations, which was a recurring user complaint.
3.  Ensure accurate, real-time graphical reports in modals and tables that persist.
4.  Prevent duplicate configuration checks to avoid server overload.

The implementation so far has focused on real-time progress, modal minimization, and, most recently and prominently, addressing the UI sluggishness, making the panel responsive, and optimizing data fetching and filtering performance by both frontend and backend enhancements.

<current_work>
The most recent work addressed critical user-reported issues regarding persistent UI sluggishness, specifically панель по прежнему долго реагирует на обновление или выбор конфигов. The  was engaged to diagnose the problem, which identified inefficient frontend re-renders (due to  triggering excessive API calls on filter changes without debouncing), unoptimized backend queries using , and a lack of proper database indexing.

The AI engineer implemented the following fixes:
1.  **Frontend Performance ():** Introduced a 300ms debouncing mechanism for filter inputs and integrated  and  hooks to optimize component rendering, significantly improving UI responsiveness.
2.  **Backend Database Optimization ():** Added comprehensive database indexes to the  model for all frequently filtered columns, such as , , , , , , , , , , and .
3.  **Backend API Query Optimization ():** Refined the  and  API endpoints to leverage the newly created database indexes and enhance the efficiency of  operations.
4.  **Critical Bug Resolution ():** Fixed two severe bugs introduced during the optimization process: a missing  decorator and a duplicate declaration of the  endpoint, which were causing Field required errors and breaking frontend filtering.

After applying these changes, comprehensive testing was conducted using screenshots and the  agent. The tests confirmed that the admin panel now loads quickly, filtering is highly responsive, Select All functions efficiently, and all relevant backend API endpoints meet performance targets (e.g., Nodes Filters at 41.7ms, Nodes All-IDs at 42.9ms, Stats API at 35.0ms). The  file was updated to reflect these successful optimizations.
