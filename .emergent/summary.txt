The trajectory documents an exhaustive and complex debugging effort on the Connexa Admin Panel. The user reported a cascade of critical issues in Russian: UI tests freezing at 90%, inaccurate ping results failing working servers, and a critical bug where servers that passed a speed test () were immediately reverted to  upon trying to start services.

The AI engineer's investigation was a deep dive into the backend logic. The initial fixes, like making the ping test less aggressive and creating a new batch testing endpoint, addressed some symptoms but failed to resolve the core status reversion problem. The engineer then embarked on a multi-stage debugging process, hypothesizing and attempting to fix several potential root causes:

1.  **Flawed Database Transactions:** The engineer correctly identified that the  session manager in  was not committing transactions properly and that manual  calls were scattered throughout . A major refactoring was done to centralize commit logic in  and remove the manual calls.
2.  **Unprotected Status Updates:** The engineer discovered dozens of code paths in  that would unconditionally set a node's status to  without checking its current state. A widespread effort was made to wrap these updates in  blocks.
3.  **Rogue Background Processes:** The final and most promising hypothesis was that a background task, , was causing a race condition or improperly updating node statuses. The engineer attempted to fix this by refining its logic and even temporarily disabling it.

Despite these extensive and logical changes, the final automated test confirmed that the fundamental bug persists. The system remains in a broken state where the status of  nodes is not reliably preserved.

<product_requirements>
The Connexa Admin Panel is a tool for managing a fleet of PPTP servers. The user's goal is to stabilize the server testing and activation pipeline, which is currently unreliable and producing incorrect results.

The primary requirements are:
1.  **Fix UI Freezing:** The combined ping + speed test and the standalone ping test cause the UI to hang at 90%, preventing users from seeing results.
2.  **Improve Testing Accuracy:** The ping algorithm is too strict, incorrectly failing functional servers. The speed test must be implemented to measure and report actual download/upload speeds, not a placeholder value.
3.  **Correct Service Activation Logic:** A critical bug causes servers that have passed a speed test (status: ) to have their status incorrectly reverted to  immediately after the Start Service function is initiated. This is the highest priority issue.
4.  **Ensure Data Integrity:** Test results for individual servers must be saved to the database immediately upon completion, rather than waiting for an entire batch to finish. This prevents data loss if a long-running test process fails midway.
5.  **Stabilize Server Import:** When importing new server configurations with a testing option enabled, the process should not automatically fail all servers.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI Framework:** The backend is built using FastAPI, handling all API logic.
- **SQLAlchemy ORM:** Used for database interaction with a SQLite database ().
- **Database Transaction Management:** A core focus of the debugging effort, specifically the dependency-injected session management () and the removal of manual  calls to prevent race conditions.
- **Asynchronous Background Tasks:** An  background task () runs periodically to check server health, and was identified as a primary suspect for the status reversion bug.
- **Conditional State Preservation:** The main coding pattern attempted was adding conditional checks () before updating a node's status to prevent valid states from being overwritten.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a Python FastAPI backend and a React frontend. The recent work was exclusively focused on the backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the main application file, containing all API endpoints, business logic, and the background task definition. It was the central focus of the entire debugging effort.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file underwent extensive modifications. Key changes include:
        -   Adding a new endpoint () to fix the 90% freeze.
        -   Implementing dozens of conditional checks () across numerous functions (, , import functions, etc.) to prevent the status of  nodes from being overwritten.
        -   Removing numerous  calls after refactoring the database session management.
        -   Modifying the  background task to be more selective and less aggressive in updating node statuses.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Defines the database models and, critically, the session management logic used throughout the application via the  dependency.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The  function was significantly refactored. The original implementation was flawed, lacking proper transaction handling. It was updated to use a  block to ensure that  is called on success and  is called on failure, centralizing transaction logic and fixing a potential root cause of data inconsistency.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains the low-level logic for testing PPTP connections and speed.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The ping test logic was made more tolerant to avoid false negatives. A placeholder for a real speed test using  was added, replacing the previous simulation.

<pending_tasks>
- **Fix the Core Status Reversion Bug**: The primary issue, where  nodes are incorrectly reverted to , remains unresolved despite multiple attempted fixes. This is the highest priority task.
- **Implement Real Speed Test**: The current speed test logic is a placeholder using  and needs to be replaced with a functional implementation that measures actual download/upload speeds.
- **Implement SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch**: The core logic for provisioning SOCKS and OVPN services is still pending.

<current_work>
The previous engineer was engaged in a deep and persistent debugging cycle to solve the critical issue of  nodes being incorrectly reverted to . The work concluded with a failed validation, meaning the application is currently in a broken state regarding this core functionality.

The final hypothesis was that a background monitoring task,  in , was causing a race condition or incorrectly updating statuses shortly after they were set. The engineer's last actions were:
1.  Confirmed that disabling the background task temporarily resolved the issue.
2.  Re-enabled the task with stricter logic, attempting to force it to only query and update nodes that are already in an  state. The following code was added to :
    
3.  Ran a final comprehensive test via the testing agent.

**Result:** The test **failed**. The automated test script confirmed that newly created  nodes were still being found with a  status in the database, proving the latest fix was ineffective. The root cause remains undiscovered.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Re-examine the  background task. The previous fix was insufficient. The next step is to add detailed logging inside the task to trace exactly which nodes it queries and what changes it attempts to commit, to finally uncover why it interferes with non- nodes.
