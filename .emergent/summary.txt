The trajectory details a follow-up debugging and refinement phase for the Connexa Admin Panel. After an initial fix for UI freezing, the user reported new, more nuanced issues in Russian: the ping test was now too strict, incorrectly failing many working servers; the combined ping + speed test was still hanging at 90%; and the start service function was incorrectly setting servers to PING Failed status immediately after they passed a speed test.

The AI engineer correctly diagnosed that the previous fix, which involved aggressive timeouts, was the root cause of the new ping inaccuracy. The engineer then systematically addressed each reported problem. The core  logic was refined to be more tolerant. For the hanging combined test, a new, optimized backend endpoint () was created in , and the frontend  was updated to use it.

The most critical fix was in the start service flow. The engineer discovered that the service launch function was re-running an aggressive ping test on nodes that had already been verified (), causing them to fail unnecessarily. The logic was updated in both  and  to bypass this redundant check for already-validated servers.

The work concluded with a comprehensive verification phase. After resolving some transient frontend login issues, the engineer successfully ran a full suite of backend and frontend automated tests, which confirmed that all reported issues were resolved. The system is now more accurate and robust.

<product_requirements>
The Connexa Admin Panel is a tool for managing a large fleet of PPTP servers. The user's primary goal is to ensure the testing and service activation pipeline is accurate and reliable.

Following an initial bug-fixing phase, the user reported that the system's testing logic had become too aggressive, leading to new problems. The updated requirements were:

1.  **Improve Ping Accuracy:** The ping test algorithm was too strict, causing many functional servers to be marked as invalid. The algorithm needed to be refined to be more tolerant of servers with slightly slower response times.
2.  **Fix Combined Ping + Speed Test:** This specific test mode continued to freeze the UI at 90% and produced inaccurate results, such as testing fewer nodes than selected. This entire process required a robust fix.
3.  **Correct Start Service Logic:** Servers that successfully passed the Speed OK state would immediately fail with PING Failed when the user tried to activate services on them. This logic needed to be corrected to prevent valid servers from being erroneously rejected.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Algorithm Refinement:** Adjusting network socket timeouts and logic in Python to balance strictness and tolerance for real-world network conditions.
- **API Endpoint Creation:** Creating a new, optimized FastAPI endpoint for a combined operation (ping + speed test) to replace a legacy, inefficient one.
- **Frontend/Backend Integration:** Updating a React component's API call to use a new, purpose-built backend endpoint.
- **State-Dependent Logic:** Modifying backend logic to change its behavior based on an object's current state (e.g., skipping a ping check if a server's status is already ).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a React frontend and a Python FastAPI backend, interacting with a MongoDB database.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, defining all API endpoints that the frontend consumes. It orchestrates the testing logic and database interactions.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  A new endpoint, , was created to provide an optimized and reliable way to run combined ping and speed tests, fixing the 90% freeze issue.
        2.  The logic within the  endpoint was modified. It now calls the PPTP test function with a parameter to skip the redundant ping check for servers that are already in the  state, resolving the start service bug.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains the  class, which implements the low-level logic for connecting to and testing individual PPTP servers. Its accuracy is critical to the entire application.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  The core  method was updated to be less aggressive, likely by adjusting timeout values or retry logic to improve accuracy.
        2.  The method was refactored to accept a new parameter () to conditionally bypass the initial ping test. This was essential for fixing the start service workflow.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This React component is the user's primary interface for initiating all types of server tests. It manages the state and API calls related to testing.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The component was updated to call the new  endpoint when the user selects the combined ping + speed test option. This change was crucial for resolving the UI freeze and improving performance.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Real Speed Test:** The current speed test logic is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with a functional implementation that measures actual download/upload speeds.
- **Implement SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch:** The core logic for provisioning SOCKS and OVPN services on servers that have reached the  status is still pending.
- **Verify Node Selection UI:** The full UI flow for selecting nodes and enabling the Start Test button needs to be re-confirmed after the recent extensive backend changes.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The most recent work was a direct response to user feedback that a previous fix had made the server ping tests too aggressive and unreliable. The engineer successfully diagnosed and fixed a cascade of related issues.

1.  **Improved Ping Algorithm**: The core ping testing logic in  was refined to be more tolerant, preventing functional servers from being incorrectly marked as failed.
2.  **Fixed Combined Test**: The ping + speed test, which was causing the UI to hang at 90%, was completely overhauled. A new, optimized backend endpoint () was created in , and the frontend () was updated to use it.
3.  **Corrected Service Launch**: A critical logic flaw was fixed where the start service function would re-run a failing ping test on servers that had already passed the speed test. The code was modified to bypass this redundant check for servers with  status.

All fixes were validated through a comprehensive suite of automated backend and frontend tests. The final tests passed, confirming that the application is now stable and the testing logic is significantly more accurate. The system is ready for user validation.

<optional_next_step>
Confirm with the user (in Russian) that the reported issues have been fixed and tested, and ask if they are ready to proceed with implementing the real speed test functionality.
