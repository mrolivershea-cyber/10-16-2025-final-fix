The trajectory outlines a complex debugging and optimization process for a Connexa Admin Panel application. Initially, the user reported a critical bug where bulk ping tests failed, while single-node tests worked correctly. The AI engineer traced this discrepancy to two different API endpoints: the correct one () used PPTP-specific checks, while the faulty bulk-test endpoint () used a generic ICMP ping.

The initial fix involved unifying the frontend to use the correct endpoint. However, this introduced a new problem: the bulk test was extremely slow and caused the UI's modal window to freeze at ~90% progress. The engineer then implemented significant backend optimizations, creating a new, parallelized endpoint () with a fast mode (reduced timeouts and attempts) to handle bulk requests efficiently.

Despite these optimizations, the user reported the freezing issue persisted, and also noted that the test was auto-starting in the modal. The engineer's latest work focused on the frontend, identifying and fixing a bug in  where the progress bar's  was not cleared on API errors, causing the freeze. The auto-start issue was investigated but the root cause was not definitively found. The work concluded after applying the progress bar fix and restarting the services, with the next step being to validate this latest fix with the user.

The Connexa Admin Panel is a web application designed to manage a large infrastructure of PPTP servers. The core functionality involves moving servers through a lifecycle of states:  ->  ->  -> .

The primary user request was to fix a critical bug where the bulk ping-testing feature (initiated via a Testing modal) incorrectly marked all servers as , even though individual tests on the same servers were successful. This issue prevented the user from accurately assessing the health of their entire server fleet.

Subsequent user feedback revealed performance issues, where the bulk test would cause the UI to freeze at approximately 90% completion. The user also reported that the test would start automatically upon opening the modal, without waiting for user input. The requirements evolved to not only fix the incorrect test logic but also to optimize the performance of bulk operations and resolve the UI usability bugs (freezing and auto-start). The system must use the specific login credentials stored for each server in the database for all tests.

- **API Endpoint Debugging**: Differentiating between two separate FastAPI endpoints ( and ) with different underlying logic (ICMP vs. PPTP port check).
- **Asynchronous Parallel Processing**: Using Python's  to run multiple network tests concurrently in a new batch endpoint () to improve performance.
- **Frontend State Management (React)**: Debugging  and  hooks in a React component () to fix UI bugs related to progress bars and event handling.
- **Network Protocol Testing**: Understanding the difference between a generic ICMP ping and a specific TCP port connection test (port 1723 for PPTP).

The application is a monorepo with a Python FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the core of the backend, defining all API routes. It contained the original divergent ping test endpoints.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: A new, optimized endpoint, , was created to handle bulk testing. This endpoint uses  for parallel execution of tests and leverages a new fast mode for quicker results. The original faulty endpoint () is now unused by the modal.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains the actual logic for testing PPTP connections and network speed.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The  function was refactored to include a  parameter. When  is , the connection timeout and number of attempts are significantly reduced, which is crucial for preventing hangs during bulk testing of unresponsive servers.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This file contained the  class which performed the incorrect ICMP-based ping.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: No changes were made to this file, but its  method was identified as the source of the original bug and is no longer called by the primary testing UI.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The React component that provides the UI for initiating bulk ping and speed tests. This was the epicenter of the UI bugs.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        1.  The API call was updated to target the new  endpoint.
        2.  A critical bug was fixed where  for the progress bar was not called within the  block of the API request, causing the UI to freeze on any error.
        3.  Additional console logging and a client-side timeout were added for better diagnostics.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main dashboard component from which the  is launched.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This file was examined to understand how the modal was triggered, but no significant code changes were made.

- **Resolve Test Auto-Start Issue**: The user reported that the test in the modal window starts automatically without waiting for selection. This needs to be investigated and fixed.
- **Implement Real Speed Test**: The placeholder speed test logic needs to be replaced with a functional implementation that measures server bandwidth.
- **Implement SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch**: The logic to provision SOCKS proxies and generate OVPN configurations for servers marked as  is still pending.

The most recent work was a direct response to user feedback that the testing modal continues to freeze at ~90% and that tests auto-start upon opening the modal.

The investigation focused on the frontend component . A critical bug was identified in the  function: the  used to update the progress bar was only cleared upon a successful API response ( block) but not in the case of an error ( block). This meant that if any network or server error occurred during the batch test, the interval would run indefinitely, leaving the progress bar frozen.

The AI engineer corrected this by adding  inside the  block and the  block to ensure the timer is always stopped, regardless of the API call's outcome.



After applying this fix, the frontend service was restarted. The investigation into the auto-start issue did not yield a clear cause, as the  hook appeared to be correctly configured. The immediate task was concluded, pending user validation of the freezing fix.

<optional_next_step>
Ask the user to verify if the latest fix has resolved the modal freezing issue and to provide more details on how to reproduce the auto-start problem.
