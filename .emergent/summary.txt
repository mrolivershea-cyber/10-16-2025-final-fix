The AI engineer's work involved several iterations to refine the Connexa Admin Panel. Initially, it addressed a bug report about server import hanging, evolving into a feature enhancement for real-time progress, batch processing, and modal minimization. The  was crucial in identifying a database misconfiguration (using SQLite while MongoDB was expected/running). Subsequent efforts focused on optimizing performance by committing to SQLite, indexing, and optimizing API queries. The most recent phase tackled user-reported UI sluggishness, Select All freezing, and real-time progress display issues. This involved standardizing SSE for all batch sizes, removing simulated progress, correcting SSE , and optimizing frontend selection logic. The work concludes with the AI beginning to test these latest fixes.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an enhanced Connexa Admin Panel capable of reliably handling large server import and testing operations without UI freezes or data loss, providing real-time feedback.
**Initial Problems:** UI freezing at 90% during imports/tests, lack of progress visibility, and blocking modals.
**Initial Requirements:** Real-time progress (processed/total), minimize functionality with  state persistence, and backend batch processing with incremental saves.
**Evolved Requirements (from user feedback):**
1.  Verify real speed test functionality.
2.  Resolve slow panel loading and UI freezing, especially for Select All.
3.  Ensure accurate, real-time graphical reports in modals and tables that persist.
4.  Prevent duplicate configuration checks to avoid server overload.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main backend application, handling API routes and business logic.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Introduced  for task states, created SSE endpoint  (fixed  to ), refactored import/testing endpoints to return  and use batch processing. Optimized  API endpoint with a single  query. Removed unused MongoDB imports.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: React component for importing nodes.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Added state for , , . Subscribes to SSE. Displays real-time progress. Implemented minimize using  for state persistence.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: React component for node testing.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Similar to  (SSE, progress display, minimize/restore). Fixed logic to ensure real-time progress is *always* displayed, not just for large batches, and removed simulated progress.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main admin interface for listing nodes and actions.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Optimized  logic to improve performance when selecting many nodes, replacing inefficient  with a more performant approach.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains core logic for ping and speed tests.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Confirmed to contain a real speed test implementation, not a placeholder.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Handles database connection and ORM setup.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Confirmed to be optimized for SQLite usage.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Document created by the AI to summarize performance optimizations.

The most recent work addressed critical user-reported issues: slow panel loading, UI freezing on Select All, and real-time progress not displaying correctly in  (stuck at 0/2336, reports disappearing).

The AI's actions involved:
1.  **Database Configuration**: Identified a misconfiguration where SQLite was used for data persistence while MongoDB was also present. Optimized the system to exclusively use SQLite by adding indexes, stopping MongoDB, and streamlining queries in  (e.g.,  API).
2.  **Real-time Progress (Frontend)**: Modified  to ensure SSE-based progress (e.g., 50/2336) is *always* displayed, regardless of batch size, removing simulated progress logic.
3.  **Real-time Progress (Backend)**: Ensured backend batch processing endpoints always return a  and corrected the  to text/event-stream for the SSE endpoint in  to ensure proper client reception.
4.  **Select All Performance**: Optimized the  function in  to use a more efficient approach for selecting many nodes, resolving UI freezing.
5.  **Stuck Nodes**: Resolved instances of nodes getting stuck in checking status.
6.  A new  was created detailing the performance improvements.

Services were restarted, and initial performance tests showed significant improvements. The AI is now in the process of thoroughly testing these latest corrections to confirm all user-reported issues are resolved.
