The trajectory documents the implementation of a complex, multi-stage server testing and deployment feature for the Connexa Admin Panel. The user provided a detailed technical specification in Russian, outlining a three-step workflow: Ping Test, Speed Test, and Service Launch (SOCKS/OVPN) for over 2,000 PPTP server configurations.

The AI engineer began by exploring the existing FastAPI/React codebase to understand the current state. The core of the work involved translating the user's requirements into functional code. This included creating new service modules for ping/speed testing () and OVPN generation (), and adding corresponding API endpoints in .

A significant portion of the work was dedicated to debugging. The engineer first resolved a critical database schema issue by creating a migration script to add required columns for SOCKS and OVPN data. A subsequent, more complex issue involved two conflicting database files, which was resolved by correcting the database connection path. Another major hurdle was the ping functionality; due to container permissions restricting ICMP, the engineer re-implemented it using a TCP socket check on the PPTP port (1723).

The work concluded after successfully demonstrating a complete, end-to-end test on a mock server, progressing its status from  through  and  to , validating the core logic of the entire workflow.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a functional admin panel to manage and deploy 2,336 PPTP server configurations. The system must automate a multi-step workflow to validate each configuration and launch services on it.

The required state-machine workflow is as follows:
1.  **Ping Test**: A node starts as . A successful ping transitions it to . A failure transitions it to .
2.  **Speed Test**: A node with  status undergoes a speed test. The measured speed (in Mbps) is saved. A successful test transitions it to .
3.  **Start Services**: A node with  status has SOCKS and OVPN services launched. This involves generating credentials (IP, Port, Login, Password) for SOCKS and a downloadable OVPN configuration file. A successful launch changes the status to .

All status changes and generated data must be persisted to the database and reflected in the UI's table. The user explicitly requested to remove the  status, which was addressed in a previous task but re-confirmed during this feature development. The final system must accurately differentiate between working and non-working configs.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Development**: Coordinated changes across a Python/FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend.
- **State Machine Implementation**: Logic to manage node status transitions ( ->  ->  -> ).
- **Database Migration**: Using a Python script to add new columns (, , , etc.) to an existing SQLAlchemy model and SQLite database.
- **Container-Aware Networking**: Replacing standard ICMP  with a TCP socket connection check to work around Docker/container permission limitations.
- **API Development**: Creating new FastAPI endpoints for each step of the testing workflow.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a standard monorepo with a decoupled backend and frontend. The backend uses FastAPI with SQLAlchemy for the ORM and a SQLite database. The frontend is built with React.

- ****
  - **Importance**: The core of the backend, containing all API endpoints.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file was heavily modified to create three new endpoints to handle the user's workflow: , , and . Logic was added to call the respective service functions, update the node status in the database based on the result, and return the outcome.

- ****
  - **Importance**: Defines the database models, including the  table.
  - **Summary of Changes**: While the file itself wasn't directly edited much, its schema was the target of a crucial migration. New columns were programmatically added to the  model's table to store SOCKS and OVPN data.

- ****
  - **Importance**: A new file created to encapsulate the network testing logic.
  - **Summary of Changes**: This file was created from scratch. It contains the  function, which was refactored from an ICMP ping to a TCP socket check on port 1723 to overcome container restrictions. It also contains placeholder logic for speed testing.

- ****
  - **Importance**: A critical one-off script created to solve a major blocker.
  - **Summary of Changes**: Created to perform a database migration, adding the , , , , and  columns to the  table without requiring a full database reset.

- ****
  - **Importance**: A utility script created during debugging.
  - **Summary of Changes**: Created to quickly populate the database with test nodes after it was accidentally cleared during the database path debugging phase. This was essential for verifying API functionality.

<pending_tasks>
- **Implement Real Speed Test**: The current speed test logic is a placeholder. It needs to be replaced with a real implementation that measures and saves download/upload speeds.
- **Implement Real SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch**: The service launch logic is mocked. It needs to be implemented to actually provision a SOCKS proxy and generate a valid, downloadable OVPN configuration file.
- **Scale to Production Data**: The solution has only been tested on a handful of mock nodes. It needs to be tested against the user's full set of 2,336 configurations.

<current_work>
The most recent work was the successful implementation and verification of the complete, end-to-end testing workflow on a single mock node. This culminated a multi-stage development and debugging process.

The key accomplishments were:
1.  **Fixing the Ping**: After discovering that ICMP pings were blocked, the ping logic in  was successfully rewritten to use a TCP socket check on the PPTP-specific port 1723.
2.  **Creating a Testable Node**: A mock working node () was added to the database, configured to respond positively to the new ping check.
3.  **Executing the Full Workflow**: The engineer sequentially called the three new API endpoints against the test node:
    - : Correctly changed the node status to .
    - : Correctly used the (currently mocked) speed test result to change the status to .
    - : Correctly used the (currently mocked) launch logic to change the status to  and populate mock SOCKS data.

The system is now in a state where the core API logic and state transitions for the entire workflow are proven to be functional, albeit with mocked service implementations for speed testing and service launching.

<optional_next_step>
The next logical step is to replace the mocked speed test logic in  with a real implementation.
