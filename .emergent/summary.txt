The trajectory describes the transition of work to a new AI engineer, focusing on the Connexa Admin Panel. Initially, the previous AI engineer simplified node imports by removing automatic testing and related UI, centralizing manual testing via . The current trajectory primarily addresses a user request to eliminate button duplication in . The AI engineer successfully removed redundant Launch Services, Ping Test, and Speed Test buttons, along with their associated handlers and unused icon imports. The process involved plan confirmation, file modifications, and thorough UI/login testing with screenshots to verify the changes and ensure core functionality remained intact. The task was concluded with all specified duplications removed and the UI confirmed to be working correctly.

<product_requirements>
The Connexa Admin Panel enables real-time server management. Initially, it required accurate progress displays, detailed import reports, UI stability, backend integrity, load optimization, and adherence to testing. Past fixes addressed import modal auto-closing and testing progress. The most recent completed feature simplified node imports by removing automatic ping/speed tests; new nodes default to not_tested;  no longer shows testing options; all testing is now manual via . The latest explicit requirement was to eliminate button duplication in : removing Launch Services and its handler, retaining Start Services; removing Ping Test and Speed Test and their handlers, retaining only the generic Testing button that opens ; and updating related comments.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented a significant simplification of the node import process, involving backend modifications in  to hardcode  and frontend changes in  to remove all testing-related UI and logic.

The most recent work focused on eliminating button duplication within the  component, as per the user's explicit request. This involved:
1.  Identifying and confirming redundant Launch Services, Ping Test, and Speed Test buttons and their associated handlers in .
2.  Removing these redundant buttons and their respective handlers (, , ).
3.  Ensuring that only the Start Services and the consolidated Testing button (which opens ) remained.
4.  Removing unused icon imports from  (e.g., , , , , , ).
5.  Performing comprehensive UI and login tests, including screenshots, to verify the correct display and functionality of the Admin Panel after the changes. The login process required re-identification of selectors due to initial errors, but ultimately, successful navigation to the Admin Panel confirmed the button removals. The remaining buttons (Start Services, Stop Services, Import, Testing) are confirmed to be present and functioning correctly.

<optional_next_step>
Address the implementation of SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch as a next feature.
