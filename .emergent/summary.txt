The trajectory outlines the transition of work from a previous AI engineer to the current one. Initially, the previous AI focused on optimizing the Connexa Admin Panel by implementing frontend debouncing, database indexing, and query optimizations to resolve UI sluggishness. When the current AI took over, the first task was to clarify requirements for SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch. However, the user immediately reported new critical issues: slow admin panel loading on refresh, failed ping tests, and incorrect status reporting.

The current AI systematically diagnosed these new problems, leveraging  to pinpoint the root causes: SQLite concurrency limitations, leading to slow concurrent API calls, and nodes getting stuck in checking status. The AI implemented several critical fixes: a  function was added to  and integrated into both the FastAPI startup event and a periodic background monitoring loop. Crucially, the SQLAlchemy engine in  was optimized using  and  to handle concurrent SQLite operations efficiently. Comprehensive testing verified that all reported issues were successfully resolved, resulting in a fast, responsive, and stable admin panel.

The Connexa Admin Panel aims to manage server import and testing, providing real-time feedback without UI freezes. Initially, it faced UI freezing during imports/tests, lack of progress, and blocking modals. Prior requirements included real-time progress, minimize functionality with  persistence, and backend batch processing. The system also needed a verified real-speed test, resolution of slow panel loading/UI freezing (especially for Select All and filters), accurate real-time reports, and prevention of duplicate configuration checks.

Most recently, the user explicitly reported three critical issues:
1.  **Slow Admin Panel Loading:** The panel was sluggish to load upon browser refresh.
2.  **Ping Test Failures:** Not all configurations were passing ping tests.
3.  **Incorrect Status Reporting:** Statuses were not displaying correctly across the application.
The implementation in the trajectory addressed these new, critical performance and reporting issues.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the work focused entirely on resolving three critical user-reported issues: persistent slow loading of the admin panel, ping test failures for certain configurations, and incorrect status reporting.

The  played a key role, diagnosing the primary issues as SQLite's poor handling of concurrent queries (leading to slow API responses) and nodes getting stuck in a checking status, affecting accurate reporting.

To address these, the following actions were taken:
1.  **Stuck Nodes Resolution**: A new asynchronous function, , was created in . This function identifies and resets nodes that have been in a checking state for too long.
2.  **Automated Cleanup Integration**: The  function was integrated into the FastAPI application lifecycle:
    *   It's called once on application startup via .
    *   It's periodically called (every 5 minutes) within the existing  task in  to ensure continuous maintenance.
3.  **Database Concurrency Optimization**: In , the SQLAlchemy engine configuration was modified to better handle SQLite's limitations with concurrency. This involved:
    *   Setting  to allow multiple threads to interact with the database connection (caution required, but necessary for SQLite with async).
    *   Implementing  to prevent SQLite connection pooling issues in a highly concurrent environment.

After these changes, comprehensive testing was performed, confirming that the admin panel now loads quickly, ping tests execute correctly, and all node statuses are reported accurately with no nodes getting stuck.
