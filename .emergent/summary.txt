The previous AI engineer successfully simplified node imports by removing automated testing features and centralizing manual testing. The initial task in this trajectory was to eliminate redundant buttons in , which was completed, ensuring a cleaner UI. The primary focus then shifted to implementing a comprehensive SOCKS service. This involved designing frontend UI components (SOCKS button, Socks Online statistics, SOCKS modal), developing backend API endpoints for SOCKS management, and integrating a robust SOCKS5 server with traffic obfuscation.

Significant challenges included correctly handling node status transitions during SOCKS launch/stop and a critical architectural misinterpretation regarding the SOCKS server's IP address. The AI engineer debugged and corrected the status logic to differentiate between manual stops and failures. Crucially, the SOCKS server's IP was correctly identified as the admin server's IP, not the individual node's IP, which was a major refactor. The final solution includes a functional SOCKS5 server, monitoring, and proxy file generation, with comprehensive backend and end-to-end testing confirming its operation.

The Connexa Admin Panel manages real-time servers. Previous work streamlined node imports by removing automatic ping/speed tests, making  testing-agnostic, and centralizing all testing via . The most recent completed request involved removing duplicate Launch Services, Ping Test, and Speed Test buttons from , retaining Start Services and a consolidated Testing button.

The current core requirement is to implement a comprehensive SOCKS service:
- **UI:** Add a SOCKS button after Testing in  to open a modal, and a Socks Online real-time statistics window. Launch SOCKS button to be renamed Start Service.
- **Node Statuses:** Remove . Transition / to  on SOCKS launch. On manual SOCKS stop, return to  if the node is alive; on node failure, revert to .
- **SOCKS Architecture:** A local SOCKS5 server on the admin panel's IP, providing unique login/password and a non-standard port. Implement traffic obfuscation against DPI (HTTP/HTTPS imitation, timing randomization, tunnel encryption, DNS leak protection). All masking settings configurable in the modal.
- **Database:** Separate DB for SOCKS logs and statistics. Main  DB to store , , ,  (fields already exist).
- **SOCKS Modal:** Settings for masking, performance (manual/auto tunnel limits, CPU/RAM monitoring), security (IP whitelist), and management (view report DB, open live proxy file, copy credentials).
- **Monitoring & Reliability:** Check tunnel status every 30 seconds with smart recovery. Automatic protection against IP leaks on SOCKS failure, with auto-reconnection attempts.
- **Proxy Text File:** Automatically manage a list of active SOCKS proxies (format: ), accessible via a modal button.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer completed the implementation of the full SOCKS service, addressing several architectural and logical challenges.

Initially, the frontend UI was updated by creating the  component and integrating it into . This involved adding a SOCKS button and a Socks Online statistical card, and adjusting the grid layout. Backend API endpoints for managing SOCKS services (, , , etc.) were created in , and the  endpoint was updated to include  count.

A critical issue was identified where the SOCKS proxy was configured to use , preventing external connections. This was corrected to use the  (representing the external IP of the admin server). The logic for node status transitions was refined: nodes now return to  (if previously  or ) on manual SOCKS stop, while falling back to  only on service failure. The  model in  was updated with a  column.

The actual SOCKS5 server was implemented in , with a corresponding  for background health checks. These components were integrated into , including their startup in the application lifecycle. Debugging involved resolving  and  issues in , and adjusting monitoring logic for node availability.  calls were explicitly added to SOCKS API endpoints to ensure data persistence.

End-to-end testing was performed:
-   A SOCKS service was successfully launched on a  node.
-   The SOCKS5 server was confirmed listening on its assigned port (e.g., 1084).
-   A  test demonstrated successful proxying, confirming traffic masquerading.
-   SOCKS statistics updated correctly, and the proxy file was accurately generated.
-   Stopping the SOCKS service correctly reverted the node status to .

The current state is that the full SOCKS system (Frontend UI, Backend API, SOCKS5 Server, Monitoring, and Database integration) is functional and verified through extensive backend and end-to-end testing, aside from the frontend modal opening issue that was identified as related to selectors when trying to select a node programmatically.
