The trajectory details an iterative development process for a universal node configuration parser. The initial request was to create a parser for six distinct data formats, handle duplicates, and report errors. The AI engineer began by implementing a rigid, format-specific parser. However, user feedback revealed its shortcomings with real-world, messy data containing headers, comments, and mixed formats.

This led to a significant refactoring. The AI engineer first attempted to make the parser smarter by adding regex fallbacks and improving text cleaning, but this approach failed on complex edge cases. The breakthrough came with a complete rewrite of the core parsing logic into a robust two-pass algorithm: first extracting all identifiable single-line formats, then processing the remainder for multi-line formats.

Subsequent user testing with a large file uncovered two more critical issues: a lack of deduplication *within* a single import batch and an unhandled error on re-importing the same file. The engineer addressed these by adding an in-memory check for batch duplicates and error handling to the API endpoint.

The final iteration focused on improving user experience. The user pointed out that the import report was uninformative when only duplicates were found. The engineer then enhanced the backend to return detailed counts (added, duplicates in DB, duplicates in request) and updated the frontend modal to display this smart report clearly. The work concluded after successfully verifying the new UI via a screenshot.

The primary goal is to create a Universal Parser for Node Import in the Connexa Admin Panel to replace an existing, non-functional one.

**Core Problem:** The current parser fails to process and import node configurations into the database from user-provided text.

**Functional Requirements:**
1.  **Data Sources:** The parser must accept input from both a manual text area (copy-paste) and file uploads ().
2.  **Parsing Algorithm:** A hybrid method is required. It should first try to match known formats, then use regular expressions (masks) for unknown but structured lines. Invalid lines must be logged to a Format error file. The parser must ignore empty lines, comments, and extraneous text.
3.  **Supported Formats:** It must handle 6 specific formats, including multi-line key-value pairs, single-line delimited strings, and variations with different separators (, , ). It also needs to handle state/country abbreviations (e.g., CA -> California).
4.  **Deduplication Logic:**
    *   Exact matches (IP + Login + Pass) should be ignored.
    *   If an IP matches but credentials differ, check a  field. If the existing record is older than 4 weeks, replace it. (Note: This specific logic is not yet implemented).
5.  **User Feedback:** After each import, a modal window must display a summary report detailing the number of unique configs added, duplicates skipped, and format errors encountered.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python) for the REST API.
- **Frontend**: React.js for the UI, specifically for the import modal.
- **Parsing Strategy**: A two-pass algorithm was implemented. The first pass uses regex to find and process all single-line formats. The second pass processes the remaining text for multi-line block formats.
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic schemas for API models.
- **Deduplication**: A two-stage process involving an in-memory Python BASH=/bin/bash

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on enhancing the user feedback mechanism for the import process. The user reported that when importing a file containing only duplicates, the report was unhelpful (0 nodes added). To address this, a smart report feature was implemented.

This involved a two-part change:
1.  **Backend ()**: The  endpoint was updated. Instead of returning a simple success message or just the number of nodes added, it now returns a detailed JSON object containing three distinct counts:
    *   : The number of new, unique nodes successfully added to the database.
    *   : The number of nodes skipped because they already existed in the database.
    *   : The number of nodes skipped because they were duplicates within the submitted text/file itself.

2.  **Frontend ()**: The React component responsible for showing the import results was modified to parse this new JSON response. It now displays a clear, itemized list, explicitly informing the user how many configurations were added and how many were skipped as duplicates, providing much more context than before.

The work was concluded after restarting both services and using the screenshot tool to visually confirm that the new, detailed report was rendering correctly in the UI.
