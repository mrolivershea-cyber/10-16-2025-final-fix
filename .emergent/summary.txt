The trajectory documents a multi-stage debugging and feature implementation process for the Connexa Admin Panel. The initial task was to investigate a user report that the server import process was hanging at 90%, a bug believed to be previously fixed. The user's requests, provided in Russian, evolved from a simple bug fix to a significant feature enhancement.

My chronological analysis reveals a multi-iteration development cycle. The first phase involved implementing a real-time progress update system using Server-Sent Events (SSE) on the FastAPI backend and integrating it into the React frontend modals (, ). This addressed the user's need for visibility during long operations.

The user then reported the hanging persisted with large datasets, leading to the second phase: implementing backend batch processing. The AI refactored the import and testing logic to process nodes in smaller chunks, committing results incrementally to prevent data loss on failure. This phase introduced significant code complexity and syntax errors, which were resolved with the help of a .

The third and final phase focused on UI/UX refinement based on detailed user feedback. This included fixing the conditional rendering of UI elements (progress bars, minimize buttons) and implementing a robust minimize/restore functionality for the modals using  to persist the state of background tasks. The final automated test confirmed that all user requirements, including real-time progress, batch processing, and stateful minimization, were successfully implemented and functional. The project is now stable and awaits further user direction.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to enhance the Connexa Admin Panel to reliably handle large-scale server import and testing operations without UI freezes or data loss, while providing clear, real-time feedback to the user.

**Core User Problems:**
1.  **UI Freezing:** The application hangs at 90% when importing or testing a large number of servers, making the feature unusable.
2.  **Lack of Feedback:** During these long operations, the user has no visibility into the current progress (e.g., how many servers have been processed).
3.  **Blocking UI:** The modals for Import and Testing block the entire admin panel, preventing the user from performing other tasks while waiting.

**Implementation Requirements:**
1.  **Real-time Progress Reporting:** Both the Import Nodes and Testing modals must display a real-time progress report, showing the number of servers processed out of the total (e.g., 50 of 200 processed).
2.  **Minimize Functionality:** Both modals must include a minimize button in the header. When clicked, the modal should close, but the background process must continue. The user should be able to re-open the modal to view the ongoing progress.
3.  **Batch Processing & Incremental Saves:** To prevent hanging and data loss, the backend must process nodes in small batches (e.g., 10-50 at a time) and save the results to the database after each batch.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **FastAPI**: Backend framework for building the API.
- **React**: Frontend library for building the user interface.
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: Used for pushing real-time progress updates from the backend to the frontend.
- **Backend Batch Processing**: Logic to break down long-running tasks into smaller, manageable chunks to prevent timeouts and UI freezes.
- **Frontend State Persistence**: Using  to save and restore the state of background tasks (like an import or test session) when a modal is minimized and re-opened.

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: This is the main backend file containing all API endpoints. It was heavily modified to support real-time progress and batch processing.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   A global dictionary () was added to manage the state of background tasks.
        -   A new Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint () was created to stream progress updates to the client.
        -   The primary import () and testing () endpoints were refactored to:
            1.  Generate a unique  for each task.
            2.  Delegate the processing to new asynchronous, batch-processing functions ().
            3.  These functions process nodes in batches, update the progress tracker, and commit to the database incrementally.
            4.  Return the  immediately to the client.

    -   **Importance**: The React component for the Import Nodes feature.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   State management was added for , , and .
        -   On initiating an import, it now calls the backend, receives a , and subscribes to the SSE endpoint using .
        -   The UI was updated to display a detailed, real-time progress bar and status messages based on the data from the SSE stream.
        -   A minimize button was added. Its handler () saves the  to  and closes the modal.
        -   Logic was added to  to check  on mount, allowing it to restore the state of a minimized process and re-subscribe to the SSE stream.

    -   **Importance**: The React component for the Testing feature.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   It underwent the same architectural changes as  to unify functionality.
        -   It was updated to call the new progress-enabled testing endpoints.
        -   It now includes the same SSE subscription, progress display, and -based minimize/restore functionality.

<current_work>
The most recent work cycle involved a complete overhaul of the long-running tasks in the application to address critical UI freezing and user experience issues. The final implementation, validated by the testing agent, successfully delivered all requested features.

1.  **Real-time Progress System**: A Server-Sent Events (SSE) system was established. The backend now generates a session ID for import/testing tasks and streams progress updates. The frontend modals subscribe to these streams to provide users with real-time feedback (e.g., Processing 50 of 200 nodes).

2.  **Backend Batch Processing**: To handle large datasets without timeouts or server strain, the import and testing logic was refactored to process nodes in small, manageable batches. Results are saved to the database after each batch, ensuring no data is lost if the process fails mid-way.

3.  **Stateful UI Minimization**: Both the Import and Testing modals now feature a minimize button. When clicked, the modal closes, but the task continues in the background. The task's  is saved to . When the user re-opens the modal, it checks , restores its state, and reconnects to the SSE stream to show the current progress.

The testing agent has confirmed that all these features are working correctly: the minimize buttons are present, the real-time report displays correctly from the start, and the state is successfully restored after minimizing.
