The trajectory outlines the transition from an AI engineer's initial work on the Connexa Admin Panel to a new AI engineer taking over. The previous work focused on critical stability fixes (Syntax/Indentation errors in ,  function) and extensive optimization of ping/speed testing. This included reducing concurrency, optimizing algorithms in , and synchronizing frontend () parameters.

The current AI engineer's task shifted from a planned SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch to an urgent bug fix. The primary issue was the Import Nodes feature not displaying testing progress in the , hanging UI, and missing import reports. The AI systematically diagnosed backend API (, ) and frontend components (, , , ).

Key decisions included introducing a  for global session management, modifying backend SSE to remove authentication and add CORS headers, and refining frontend logic to auto-connect  to import-initiated test sessions. After iterative debugging, including user-reported failures, all issues related to import progress display, UI responsiveness, and reporting were successfully resolved.

The Connexa Admin Panel aims for real-time management of server import and testing with a responsive UI and clear feedback. Initial requirements focused on fixing login/panel unresponsiveness, optimizing Ping/Speed test performance, ensuring testing accuracy, managing server load, and synchronizing UI defaults.

The user's recent explicit request centered on issues with the Import nodes functionality:
1.  **Correct Progress Display**: Ensure testing progress, initiated via the Import Nodes modal, is displayed in the main Testing modal, similar to manual tests.
2.  **Import Report**: Immediately after import, show a report with Added, Matched, Updated, and Duplicate node counts.
3.  **UI Stability**: Prevent the Import modal from hanging or closing prematurely after starting tests.
4.  **Backend Integrity**: Verify data flow from Import modal to backend to testing queue, ensuring test tasks are created and processed.
5.  **Load Optimization**: Prevent server freezes, delays, or user logout after mass import and testing, maintaining session stability.
6.  **Key Testing Parameters**: Adhere to optimized default parameters: Ping concurrency 15, Speed concurrency 8, Ping timeout 0.5s, Speed timeout 2s, Speed sample 32KB.

<key_technical_concepts>

-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for backend APIs (e.g., , ).
-   **React/Vite**: JavaScript library for frontend UI.
-   **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: For real-time progress updates from backend to frontend.
-   **React Context API**: For global state management (e.g.,  for active test sessions).
-   **Asyncio/Semaphores**: For concurrent operations in Python backend.
-   **CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)**: For secure cross-domain communication, especially with SSE.

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Central backend for API routes, business logic, and background tasks like node import and testing.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   The  endpoint was modified: authentication was removed () because EventSource doesn't support authorization headers, and explicit CORS headers (, , ) were added to the  to allow cross-origin SSE connections.
        -   The  function (implicitly, as it's called by ) was confirmed to correctly initiate testing and generate .
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Core logic for ping and speed tests.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: No direct changes in this trajectory, but its optimized functions are crucial for the accelerated testing performance.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Root component, defines routing and global context providers.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Wrapped the main  component with  to make the  available throughout the application.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main admin interface for node listing and actions.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   Imported  and .
        -   Integrated  around  (though this was later moved to ).
        -   Added logic to display an active testing indicator (a red dot) on the Testing button if  returns a value greater than 0, reflecting ongoing import tests.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: React component for node testing, displaying real-time progress.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   Integrated  context to access and update active test sessions.
        -   Modified  to check for active import sessions () and automatically connect to them, ensuring progress display upon modal opening.
        -   Updated  to mark the relevant session in  as  or .
        -   Updated  to register manually initiated tests with .
        -   Added UI logic to display a badge (Из импорта) in the modal title if the current session originated from an import, indicating the source of the test.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: React component for importing nodes, including SSE-based progress.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   Integrated  context to register new import-initiated test sessions upon successful node import, passing , , and .
        -   Improved the import report displayed to the user (, , , , ).
        -   Added toast notifications for successful import and test initiation.
        -   Ensured the modal doesn't automatically close after test initiation.
-   **** (NEW FILE)
    -   **Importance**: Provides a global React context for managing active test sessions (both manual and import-initiated) across the application, allowing  and  to react to ongoing tests.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Created this new file, exporting  and  hook. It manages a state variable  (a map of  to session details) and provides functions to add, update, remove, and retrieve sessions.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI successfully resolved critical issues related to the Import nodes functionality. The user had reported that after importing nodes and initiating a test (Ping Only/Speed Only), the UI would hang, no import report would appear, and no testing progress would be displayed in the .

The AI conducted a thorough diagnosis, confirming that the backend correctly generated  and processed tests asynchronously, with the SSE endpoint providing real-time progress. The core problem was identified as a frontend integration gap and a backend SSE authorization issue.

The following comprehensive fixes were implemented:
1.  ** (New File)**: A new React Context () was created to manage active testing sessions globally, allowing components like  to register new test sessions and  to subscribe to them.
2.  ** Modifications**: Updated to use  to register import-initiated test sessions. The modal now displays a detailed import report (added, duplicates, replaced, errors) and does not close prematurely.
3.  ** Modifications**: Integrated  to display an indicator (red dot) on the Testing button when active test sessions are present, signaling ongoing background tests.
4.  ** Modifications**: Enhanced to automatically detect and connect to active import-initiated sessions stored in  upon opening. It now correctly displays real-time progress for these sessions and includes a Из импорта badge to indicate the test source. Logic for manual tests was also updated to register sessions with the context.
5.  ** Modifications**: Wrapped the entire application in  to ensure  is accessible globally.
6.  **Backend  Modifications**: Critical fixes for the SSE endpoint () included removing authentication (as  doesn't support headers) and adding explicit CORS headers to ensure successful cross-origin connections.

After these changes, backend and frontend functionalities were fully tested and validated. The import process is now stable, provides immediate feedback, and correctly visualizes testing progress in the .
