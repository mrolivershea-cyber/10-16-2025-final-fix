The AI engineer successfully established the Connexa Admin Panel application, moving from a basic Hello World to a feature-rich MVP. Initially, the project was a React frontend with a FastAPI/MongoDB backend. Following user input, the AI architected a switch to PostgreSQL (though later reverted to SQLite due to environment constraints), implemented a comprehensive backend with SQLAlchemy models and JWT/session-based authentication, and built a modern React UI using ShadCN.

Key development phases included setting up the core CRUD functionality for nodes, implementing various import/export features, and adding service management capabilities (PPTP/SOCKS start/stop) and node testing (ping/speed). Throughout the process, the AI diligently addressed numerous bugs, including dependency issues, database schema mismatches (requiring a database reset), and frontend interactivity problems (e.g., broken checkboxes, incorrect prop passing, duplicate function declarations). The engineer also refactored the UI based on user feedback, unifying node creation and streamlining service control buttons. The current state reflects a functional admin panel with node management, import, testing, and basic service control, ready for further development of the more complex features outlined in the extensive problem statement.

<product_requirements>
The user requested a unified Connexa v1.7 admin panel for managing network connections (MVP: PPTP, with SOCKS/OVPN over PPTP). The goal is a centralized panel for importing connections, data normalization (geo-data), quick/full checks (including SOCKS), task queuing, export/streaming, flexible filters, logging, auditing, and scalability to agents.

**Implemented features so far include:**
1.  **Core Node Management**: CRUD operations for nodes with fields like IP, Login, Password, Protocol (PPTP, SSH, SOCKS, SERVER, OVPN), Country, State, City, ZIP, Provider, Tags, Comment, Status.
2.  **Data Import/Parsing**: Supports multiple text formats (A-G) and XLSX with column mapping, including dry-run preview and basic data normalization.
3.  **Authentication**: JWT-based and session authentication, forced password change on first login, admin/admin default.
4.  **UI/UX**: React frontend with ShadCN UI components, responsive design, unified Add Server button, inline editing, show/hide password, copy SOCKS config, advanced filtering with search/reset, Only Online toggle.
5.  **Service Management (Partial)**: Buttons to start/stop PPTP/SOCKS services for selected nodes, and node testing (ping/speed/both).
6.  **Error Handling**: Basic toast notifications for actions.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing user feedback regarding the UI and functionality of various buttons and actions. The user explicitly requested:
1.  Removal of the Service Control button and its associated modal.
2.  Addition of Start Services (green) and Stop Services (red) buttons directly under the filter panel.
3.  Fixing all context menu actions for nodes (Start Services, Stop Services, Test Ping, Copy IP, Copy SOCKS, Delete).
4.  Fixing the Delete Selected button for bulk deletion.

The AI engineer successfully implemented these changes:
-   ** was modified**: The  import and usage were removed. New  and  buttons were added below the filters, with distinct green and red styling. Functions  and  were added to manage these actions for selected nodes.
-   ** was deleted**: This file became redundant after moving its functionality.
-   ** and  were updated for **: The frontend now correctly sends an array of node IDs, and the backend endpoint  was updated to accept this format and perform the deletion.
-   **Context Menu Actions**: While the previous summary indicated these were working, the user's explicit request to Fix Node Context Menu Actions suggests further verification/fixing was intended. The AI's last action focused on the bulk actions and main  buttons, and didn't detail specific fixes for individual context menu items beyond what was implicitly addressed by ensuring the underlying API calls and  functions were correct in earlier steps.

The latest screenshot () confirms the UI changes: the  button is gone, and the  and  buttons are present with correct styling and placement. The node count is 36, showing successful data loading. The system is reported as ready for testing of all these operations.
