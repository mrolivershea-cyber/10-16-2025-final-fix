The AI engineer's work spanned initial debugging, feature implementation, and extensive issue diagnosis, particularly around testing algorithms. Initially, efforts focused on correcting ,  (PPTP authentication), and  functionalities, including fixing a critical bug where  was expected instead of  and addressing a  issue involving fake random speeds. A recurring speed test freezing problem led to a deep dive into an aggressive deduplication mechanism. The AI engineer then implemented a comprehensive solution for deduplication with separate TTLs and improved user feedback. Subsequently, a new speed test freezing issue was diagnosed as an inadequate  and missing timeouts, which was fixed by integrating  and implementing robust  timeouts. Finally, the AI engineer performed multiple PING LIGHT and PING OK test runs as requested by the user, and was last tasked with estimating PING LIGHT performance for 100,000 nodes.

The user initially sought a project overview and then a detailed enhancement for  (faster, unauthorized PPTP port checking with specific parallelism/timeout presets). Key issues emerged:  yielding false positives,  inaccuracies (measuring admin's speed, not VPN throughput), lack of real-time UI updates, and persistent  test freezes. The overarching goal was to ensure all testing algorithms (, , ) deliver accurate, real-time results for a large VPN node database. This involved fixing  vs.  discrepancies, removing fake speed data, implementing a robust PPTP speed test, and addressing system freezes due to aggressive deduplication and insufficient timeouts in network operations. Recent requirements included a full diagnostic run on 2336 nodes for PING LIGHT, PING OK, and SPEED OK, followed by performance estimates for large datasets.

<pending_tasks>
-   Complete the report for PING LIGHT test time estimation for 100,000 nodes.
-   Continue and complete the SPEED OK testing on the 1816  nodes, which was interrupted by the deduplication freeze diagnosis. This includes potential adjustments to concurrency if speeds remain slow.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer had just resolved a recurring speed test freezing issue, which was ultimately traced to persistent entries in the deduplication registry ( and ) not being cleared correctly, causing nodes to be skipped with wait 0s. The fix involved refining the  logic in  to ensure  is called for skipped nodes and adding forced cleanup for  entries. After confirming this fix, the user requested an estimate for the PING LIGHT test duration for 100,000 nodes, which the AI engineer was in the process of generating. The prior SPEED OK test on 1816  nodes was running but paused due to the reported freeze.
