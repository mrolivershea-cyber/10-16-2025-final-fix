The AI engineer's trajectory focused on developing and refining a VPN node testing application. Initial efforts resolved critical bugs in , , and  algorithms, particularly addressing  errors and null byte corruption in PPTP logic. A major challenge was accurate  measurement, which led to a pivot from custom TCP-based methods, through a failed Speedtest.net CLI integration (due to concurrency and ephemerality), back to an improved, real-data TCP throughput measurement. Significant time was spent debugging  and  issues. The engineer meticulously addressed user feedback on test stability, fixed deduplication logic, and extensively refined the UI for compactness and intuitive parameter selection, including dynamic display of settings and presets. The process involved multiple iterations of implementing, testing, and debugging, adhering to strict logic interpretations for status transitions across , , and  states. The AI engineer also diligently used the  to diagnose complex issues.

The user initially required a robust system for testing PPTP VPN node connectivity and speed, including  (fast TCP port 1723 check),  (PPTP authentication with database credentials), and  (VPN throughput). Key issues were  false positives,  inaccuracies (measuring admin's speed, not VPN), and test freezes. The core problem was inaccurate results from all algorithms.
Explicit requests evolved to include:
- Real, accurate data for all tests.
- Real PPTP authentication using database credentials.
- Accurate speed measurements (real VPN throughput).
- Sequential testing ( ->  -> ) via the web interface, then refined to smart logic where tests run for all nodes, but automatically perform prerequisites if needed (e.g.,  triggers  then  if node isn't ).
- Specific test parameters and concurrency for large-scale testing (2336 nodes).
- Thorough investigation of  and  misses, identifying root causes like incorrect credentials, PPTP authentication specifics, bruteforce protection, and network issues.
- Detailed logic for status transitions:  as the default baseline status; any failure in  or  reverts to .
- UI improvements for the : compact display, dynamic settings based on test type, correct default values, and intuitive presets for concurrency, timeouts, and sample size.
- Ensure the SOCKS button in the Admin Panel is always active for monitoring.

        -   Adjusted  values (initially to 1, then to 5, then to 8) to optimize speed tests.
        -   Modified  to include multiple timeout attempts for PING LIGHT stability, later reverted to single attempt for speed.
        -   Updated  to use  for PING OK (later reverted to direct  without retries for speed).
        -   Critical fixes to status update logic in  (and related functions) to strictly adhere to user's ping_light is baseline rule, ensuring correct fallback statuses upon test failures.
        -   Implemented smart logic for sequential tests (e.g.,  request automatically triggers  then  if necessary, stopping if prerequisites fail).
        -   Fixed deduplication logic:  now correctly clears  to ensure stable test results, and  was adjusted.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was focused on refining the user interface of the  component and ensuring core logic consistency. The user had requested further compactness in the  because scrolling was still required when selecting the SPEED test type, and overall blocks felt too large.

The AI engineer addressed this by:
1.  **Refactoring **: Combining two  blocks into a single, more compact structure.
2.  **Streamlining Selected Nodes**: Making the Selected Nodes display a single, compact line.
3.  **Reducing Element Sizes**: Decreasing the dimensions of input fields and buttons.
4.  **Adjusting Spacing**: Changing  to  to reduce vertical gaps between elements.

After these UI changes, the frontend was restarted and successfully compiled.

Additionally, as the very last action, the AI engineer made the SOCKS button in  active at all times, removing the  condition  as per user request, to allow for monitoring and quick configuration without needing selected nodes. This change was also followed by a successful frontend restart and compilation.

The core backend testing logic has been refined through multiple iterations, including:
-   A stable, custom TCP-based speed measurement (after abandoning Speedtest CLI).
-   Corrected status update logic ensuring  is the ultimate fallback on  or  failure.
-   Smart logic where a  test request will automatically perform  and  prerequisites if the node status isn't , halting the sequence if any prerequisite fails.
-   Optimized concurrency and timeouts for , , and  tests to balance speed and accuracy.
-   Deduplication logic fixed to prevent interference with test results.

The system is now in a state where the UI is highly compact and functional, and the backend testing algorithms adhere strictly to the complex user-defined logic for test execution and status transitions.
