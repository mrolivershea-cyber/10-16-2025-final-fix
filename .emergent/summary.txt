The AI engineer continued development on the Connexa Admin Panel, focusing on the SOCKS service. Initially, the SOCKS feature was implemented, including UI, backend APIs, SOCKS5 server, monitoring, and database integration. However, a critical frontend issue persisted: the SOCKS modal wouldn't open, and the View DB Report and Open Proxy File functions only offered downloads, not online viewing. The user confirmed these as immediate problems.

The AI first validated the backend, confirming SOCKS API functionality. It then meticulously debugged the frontend, discovering the SOCKS button was conditionally disabled, preventing the modal from ever appearing. While the root cause of  not updating correctly wasn't fully resolved, a pragmatic decision was made to temporarily disable the button's  logic. Concurrently, the AI refactored  to render DB reports and proxy files directly within new modal components, complete with copy/download options, and enhanced error messages. This comprehensive approach resolved all stated user issues.

The Connexa Admin Panel manages real-time servers, with recent work streamlining node imports and consolidating testing. The primary requirement was to implement a comprehensive SOCKS service. This included a SOCKS button and Socks Online statistics in . Node statuses needed refinement:  removal, / to  on SOCKS launch, and intelligent reversion to  or  on manual stop or failure. The SOCKS architecture mandated a local SOCKS5 server on the admin panel's IP with unique credentials, non-standard ports, and traffic obfuscation configurable in the . A separate DB for SOCKS logs and statistics was needed, with existing  DB fields (, , , ) used. The SOCKS modal required settings for masking, performance, security, and management actions, specifically view report DB and open live proxy file *online*, not downloaded. Monitoring and reliability were crucial, including 30-second checks, smart recovery, and auto-reconnection. An automatically managed  proxy text file, viewable via the modal, was also required.

Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed critical user-reported issues concerning the SOCKS service:
1.  **SOCKS Modal Not Opening:** The SOCKS button in  was found to be  even when nodes were selected, preventing the  from opening. While the underlying cause for  not updating correctly wasn't fully fixed, a workaround was implemented by removing the  attribute from the SOCKS button in  (line 601 in a previous edit). This allowed the modal to open and present clearer user feedback.
2.  **Online Viewing of Reports/Proxy Files:** The user's request to view the SOCKS database report and proxy file online instead of downloading was fulfilled.  was significantly modified to incorporate two new internal modal components:  and . These modals now display JSON-formatted database reports and plain text proxy file content directly within the UI. Both new modals include Копировать (Copy) and Скачать (Download) buttons for user convenience.
3.  **Improved SOCKS Launch Feedback:** Error messages and guidance within the  were enhanced to clearly instruct users that nodes need to be in  or  status to launch SOCKS, improving the user experience for the SOCKS not starting issue.

The backend API for SOCKS was confirmed fully functional through testing. End-to-end testing demonstrated that the SOCKS modal now opens, reports and proxy files are viewable online, and copy/download functionalities work within the new modals.
