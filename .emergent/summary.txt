The AI engineer's trajectory commenced with a deep dive into the Connexa Admin Panel's , addressing a user reported issue where PING LIGHT tests failed to initiate and displayed incorrect labels. The engineer systematically debugged the frontend (, ) and backend (, ), identifying and rectifying issues such as an incorrect default test type, disabled Start Test button, and the backend's lack of a specific batch processing endpoint for PING LIGHT tests. This involved creating new API endpoints, modifying data schemas to support Select All functionality, and correcting  usage.

Subsequently, the focus shifted to ensuring mass actions (testing, SOCKS proxy, deletion) correctly respected UI filters and the Select All mode. The engineer implemented changes to pass  and  from  to  and , and updated corresponding backend endpoints (, ) to incorporate these filters during processing.

The final, and currently ongoing, phase of work involves debugging a discrepancy in node import counts, where a file () previously yielding 2336 configurations now yields 2419. Initial investigation wrongly focused on Format 7 parsing, but later analysis revealed that Format 7 was not present in the file. The latest finding points to a deeper issue within the parsing logic, specifically that each configuration is being processed or added twice, potentially due to issues in  or the block splitting logic, leading to duplicate nodes before the final de-duplication step.

The Connexa Admin Panel requires a robust SOCKS service with a comprehensive UI, backend APIs, SOCKS5 server, monitoring, and database integration, featuring a SOCKS button and Socks Online statistics. Node statuses (/) must update. The  needs settings for masking, performance, security, and management, alongside report DB and live proxy file viewing. The system must support  node import. A critical requirement is handling large node configuration uploads (e.g., 1.5MB) without freezing the app, incorporating a detailed, unified, and persistent progress report (percentages, Cancel button). Performance for mass node selection/deletion must be improved. Two ping methods (fast PING LIGHT and full PING OK with authorization) and accurate speed test results are essential.

The user explicitly requested fixing non-functional document/text buffer imports, ensuring the import report remained visible, optimizing large file import performance, and restoring graphical progress, control buttons (minimize/cancel), and session recovery. Recent focus has been on fixing the Testing Modal, ensuring proper default test types, full Select All functionality without freezing, and initiating tests correctly. Furthermore, mass actions (testing, SOCKS, deletion) must correctly apply active filters from the UI. The current problem being addressed is an inconsistency in node import counts, where a specific file now yields more nodes than previously expected, indicating a parsing or duplication issue.

<pending_tasks>
-   Diagnose and fix the import parsing duplication issue:
    -   Investigate why the import process for  yields 2419 nodes instead of the expected 2336.
    -   Specifically, identify why each config appears to be duplicated in the parsing stage, leading to twice the expected number of unique configurations before a final de-duplication. The current suspicion is an issue in  or the block splitting logic.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was deep-diving into a critical import parsing issue reported by the user. The user observed that importing the  file, which previously resulted in 2336 configurations, now yields 2419. Initial investigations into Format 7 as the cause were disproven, as  and  did not identify any Format 7 entries in the provided file.

The engineer performed a series of tests, including deleting all existing nodes and re-importing, which confirmed the 2419 count. A custom Python script was developed to analyze the  and  files independently, which correctly identified 2336 unique configurations, validating the user's original expected count.

Further analysis of the 's parsing logic, specifically within  and the block splitting for  (lines 1348-1366), led to a potential fix (Chat Message 313) to prevent  blocks from being incorrectly split and duplicated. However, after applying this fix and restarting the backend, re-testing with a custom script using the *real* parser logic revealed that while the count improved (2335, close to 2336), duplicate nodes were still being generated. The most recent observation is that each config is still being duplicated, suggesting the problem lies in the entire file being processed twice, likely within  or the subsequent block processing, rather than just in the splitting logic of Format 6.
