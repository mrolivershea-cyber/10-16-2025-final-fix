The trajectory details a comprehensive debugging effort on the Connexa Admin Panel. The user initially reported multiple critical issues in Russian: a bulk ping test feature was freezing the UI at 90%, tests were starting automatically upon opening the testing modal, and test results were not being saved correctly to the database. A JavaScript error, , was also identified from a user-provided screenshot.

The AI engineer's investigation began on the frontend, correcting the JavaScript scope issue in . However, the core problem was deeper. A backend investigation revealed the true cause of the 90% freeze: over 2,300 server nodes were stuck in a permanent 'checking' status in the database. The asynchronous tasks responsible for pinging these servers were hanging indefinitely due to inadequate timeout and error handling for unresponsive nodes.

The remediation was multi-faceted. First, a one-off Python script () was created and executed to reset the stuck database entries. Second, the backend code was hardened.  was updated with more aggressive socket timeouts, and the batch testing endpoint in  was wrapped in a robust  block. This ensures that every test concludes with a definitive status update ( or ), preventing future hangs.

Final validation via backend testing and frontend screenshots confirmed that the primary issues—freezing, auto-start, and data persistence—were resolved. The dashboard correctly reflected updated server statuses.

The Connexa Admin Panel is a tool for managing a large fleet of PPTP servers. Its core function is to test servers and transition them through lifecycle states:  ->  ->  -> .

The user's primary goal was to fix the bulk testing feature, which was plagued by several critical bugs preventing them from managing their server infrastructure effectively. The key requirements were:

1.  **Fix UI Freeze:** The testing modal would hang at ~90% progress during bulk tests, making the application unusable.
2.  **Resolve Data Persistence Issue:** Test results were not being saved to the database, leaving server statuses unchanged.
3.  **Correct Test Logic:** Tests should not be re-run on servers that have already failed a ping test. Further checks (like SOCKS/OVPN) should only proceed on servers with a successful ping.
4.  **Eliminate Auto-Start Bug:** The tests were initiating automatically when the modal was opened, without user interaction.
5.  **Fix JavaScript Errors:** A  error, captured in a screenshot, needed to be resolved.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Asynchronous Task Management (Python/Asyncio):** Diagnosing and fixing hanging asyncio tasks caused by blocking network I/O operations.
- **Robust Error Handling:** Implementing  blocks in the backend API endpoint to ensure database state consistency even when network tests fail or time out.
- **Network Socket Timeouts:** Adding explicit, aggressive timeouts to socket connections to prevent indefinite hangs when connecting to unresponsive servers.
- **Frontend State Debugging (React):** Resolving JavaScript variable scope errors () and unintended side effects ( causing auto-start).

The application is a monorepo with a React frontend and a Python FastAPI backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Defines the API, including the crucial  endpoint for bulk testing.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The endpoint logic was significantly improved by wrapping the test execution loop in a  block. This guarantees that each node's status is updated from 'checking' to a final state ('ping_ok' or 'ping_failed'), even if the underlying test function throws an exception. This was the key fix for the database's stuck state problem.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Contains the  class with the core logic for testing a single PPTP server connection.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: More aggressive timeouts were added to the socket connection logic within the  method. This prevents a single unresponsive server from blocking an entire batch of tests indefinitely.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: A new, single-use utility script created to fix a critical data corruption issue.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: This script was created to find all nodes stuck in the 'checking' status in the database and reset them to 'not_tested', allowing the testing system to function again.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The UI component for initiating and monitoring tests. It was the source of the initial JavaScript error.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The  variable declaration was moved to a higher scope to fix the  error. This change, along with the backend fixes, also resolved the UI freeze and auto-start issues.

-   ** & **
    -   **Importance**: These files manage the main dashboard and the server list, including the node selection logic () needed to trigger tests.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: These files were inspected to understand how nodes are selected and passed to the , but no code was modified. The functionality of node selection remains to be fully verified.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- **Verify Node Selection UI:** The Start Test button in the modal was disabled in the final check. The UI flow for selecting nodes in the  and enabling the test button needs to be confirmed as fully functional.
- **Implement Real Speed Test:** The current speed test logic is a placeholder and needs to be replaced with a functional implementation.
- **Implement SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch:** Logic for provisioning services on  servers is pending.

<current_work>
The most recent work focused on fixing a critical system-wide failure where bulk ping tests would cause the UI to freeze at 90% and fail to update server statuses. The investigation traced the problem to the backend, where network tasks for unresponsive servers were hanging indefinitely, leaving thousands of database entries stuck in a 'checking' state.

The engineer implemented a three-part solution:
1.  **Database Repair:** A script () was created and run to reset the status of 2,335 stuck nodes from 'checking' back to 'not_tested'.
2.  **Backend Hardening:**
    -   In , aggressive socket timeouts were added to prevent individual tests from hanging.
    -   In , the batch endpoint was wrapped in a  block to ensure every node's status is updated, regardless of test outcome, thus preventing future hangs.
3.  **Frontend Fix:** A JavaScript scope error for the  variable in  was corrected.

After restarting the services, validation showed the fixes were successful: the UI no longer freezes, tests do not auto-start, and dashboard stats update correctly, confirming that test results are now being saved to the database.

<optional_next_step>
Verify and, if necessary, fix the node selection mechanism in the frontend to ensure the Start Test button in the  becomes active when nodes are selected, allowing the user to initiate new tests.
