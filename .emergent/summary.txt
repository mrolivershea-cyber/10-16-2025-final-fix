The trajectory details the identification and resolution of a significant UX limitation in the application's admin panel. The user reported that the Select All functionality was misleading, as it only selected the 200 nodes visible on the current page due to pagination, not the entire dataset of 4,688 nodes. This prevented the user from performing bulk actions on all nodes or on a complete filtered subset.

The AI engineer engaged in a detailed clarification process with the user in Russian to create a comprehensive technical specification. This involved identifying all affected action buttons, including those in the main panel and within a . A key discovery was that the duplicated Ping and Speed test buttons served different purposes: one set modified the node's status in the database as part of a workflow, while the other was for informational testing only.

The solution involved a full-stack approach. First, a new backend endpoint, , was created in  to efficiently fetch the IDs of all nodes matching the current filter criteria. Second, the frontend component  was extensively refactored. A new state, , was introduced to hold the complete list of selected IDs, decoupling the selection logic from the paginated display. Consequently, the  function and every single action button handler (, , etc.) were updated to use this new comprehensive list of IDs.

The work concluded with successful backend API testing and a full validation of the frontend changes by the automated testing agent, confirming the feature was implemented correctly.

<product_requirements>
The user needs to manage a large database of server configurations (nodes) through an admin panel. The current implementation displays nodes in a paginated table showing 200 entries at a time, but this creates a major limitation: the Select All button and all subsequent bulk actions (e.g., Start/Stop Services, Ping Test, Delete) only operate on the 200 visible nodes, not the entire dataset or a complete filtered result.

The core requirement is to fix this logical flaw. The Select All button must select *all* nodes that match the current filter criteria, even those not visible on the screen. All action buttons in the  and the associated  must be modified to perform their operations on this complete selection of nodes. The UI should also be updated to clearly display the total number of selected nodes (e.g., X of Y selected) to avoid user confusion, while maintaining the performance benefit of showing only 200 nodes per page.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Backend API Enhancement:** Creation of a new FastAPI endpoint () to efficiently return a list of all node IDs based on query parameters, without fetching full object data.
- **Frontend State Management:** Decoupling UI view from data state. A separate state variable was introduced in React to manage the list of all selected node IDs, independent of the paginated data being displayed.
- **Full-Stack Feature Implementation:** The solution required coordinated changes in both the Python backend (new data endpoint) and the React frontend (state management, API consumption, and UI logic updates).
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application is a monorepo with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React.js frontend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This file contains all API endpoints. It was modified to support the new frontend requirement of fetching all node IDs at once.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** A new GET endpoint  was added. This endpoint reuses the existing filtering logic from the main  endpoint but returns only a list of node IDs (), which is a lightweight operation for the frontend to handle.
        

-   ****
    -   **Importance:** This is the primary component for node management and was the main focus of the development work. It contains the table, filters, and all action buttons.
    -   **Summary of Changes:** The component was heavily refactored:
        1.  **New State:** A new state variable  was added to track all selected node IDs across all pages.
        2.  **Updated Selection Logic:**  was modified to call the new  endpoint and populate .  was updated to manage this new .
        3.  **Refactored Action Handlers:** All button handlers (, , , , etc.) were changed to use the  set instead of the old  array. The payload sent to the backend now consists of all selected IDs: .
        4.  **UI Display:** The Select All checkbox and its label were updated to reflect the total selection count from .
        5.  **Modal Props:** The props passed to  and  were updated to send the full list of selected IDs ().
        6.  **Filter Reset:** Logic was added to  to clear  whenever the filters change to ensure selection consistency.

<current_work>
The most recent work cycle involved implementing a critical user-requested feature to fix the Select All functionality in the admin panel. Previously, Select All and all associated bulk actions were limited to the 200 nodes visible on the current page, which was functionally incorrect for a dataset of over 4,000 nodes.

The implementation is now complete and addresses the issue comprehensively:
1.  **Backend Support:** A new endpoint, , was added to the FastAPI backend. It efficiently provides the frontend with a list of all node IDs that match the user's active filters.
2.  **Frontend Logic Overhaul:** The  component was significantly refactored. It now maintains a state () that tracks every selected node ID, regardless of pagination.
3.  **Complete Functionality:** The Select All checkbox now fetches all relevant IDs from the new backend endpoint. All action buttons (Start/Stop, Ping Test, Speed Test, Launch, Delete, Export, etc.) have been updated to use this complete list of selected nodes, ensuring that actions are performed on the entire desired set.
4.  **UI/UX Improvement:** The UI now correctly displays the total count of selected nodes, providing clear feedback to the user.

The work concluded with a successful automated frontend test run, which validated that the new selection logic works as expected and that bulk actions are correctly triggered with all selected node IDs. The system is now pending final review and acceptance by the user.
