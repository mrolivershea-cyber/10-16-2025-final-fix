The trajectory details the transition of development to a new AI engineer, starting with a comprehensive overview of the Connexa Admin Panel's existing state, including product requirements, current work (fixes for import modal hanging and testing progress persistence), and key technical concepts. The main task for the current AI engineer emerged from user feedback (Chat Message 8) requesting a simplification of the node import process: disabling automatic testing upon import, setting newly added nodes to not_tested status, removing testing options from the import UI, and performing all tests manually via the . The AI engineer successfully implemented these changes in both the backend () and frontend (), removing automatic test initiation and UI elements. The modifications were thoroughly validated by both frontend and backend testing agents, confirming the new, simplified import workflow and persistence of testing status.

<product_requirements>
The Connexa Admin Panel aims to provide real-time management of server import and testing with a responsive UI and clear feedback. Initial requirements included:
1.  **Correct Progress Display**: Real-time testing progress for import-initiated tests in .
2.  **Import Report**: Detailed import results (Added, Matched, Updated, Duplicate counts).
3.  **UI Stability**: Prevent UI hangs in the Import modal and ensure smooth operation.
4.  **Backend Integrity**: Seamless data flow from Import modal to backend testing queue.
5.  **Load Optimization**: Server stability during mass imports and testing.
6.  **Key Testing Parameters**: Adherence to optimized default testing parameters.

Recent updates (prior to the latest task) addressed issues where the import modal was not auto-closing and testing progress disappeared from .

The latest explicit user request is to significantly simplify the node import process:
1.  **Remove Automatic Testing**: Discontinue automatic ping/speed tests upon node import.
2.  **Default Not Tested Status**: All newly imported nodes should default to a not_tested status.
3.  **Simplified Import UI**: Remove all testing-related options and dropdowns from the .
4.  **Manual Testing Only**: Users will manually initiate all tests via the separate .
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for backend APIs.
-   **React/Vite**: JavaScript library for frontend UI.
-   **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: For real-time progress updates.
-   **React Context API**: For global state management ().
-   **Asyncio/Semaphores**: For concurrent operations in Python backend.
-   **CORS**: For secure cross-domain communication.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Central backend for API routes, business logic, background tasks. Specifically handles .
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Modified  endpoint. Forced . Removed the entire block of code responsible for initiating and running automatic tests. Updated the import success and error reports to explicitly set  to  and remove testing-related messages, reflecting the removal of automatic testing.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Defines data structures for request and response validation.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Verified  already had  as a default, aligning with the not_tested requirement without needing further modification.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: React component for importing nodes and displaying import reports.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Removed  hook and associated state/logic. Removed the UI selection element (dropdown/radio buttons) for testing mode. Modified  to not send  in the payload. Updated the success handling to no longer process  or interact with  for test initiation. Updated  to reflect the simplified import process.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch**: Core business logic for provisioning SOCKS and OpenVPN services on managed servers, including backend API design and frontend integration.
-   **Future Automation with Auxiliary Servers**: Automating the testing process with helper servers.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed new critical user-reported issues concerning the Import nodes functionality and , which included the import modal not auto-closing and testing progress disappearing. The previous work involved implementing automatic closure of  and revising  to prevent aggressive clearing of session IDs and persist testing progress more robustly.

Most recently, the user requested a significant simplification of the node import process. This involved:
1.  **Backend Changes ():** The  endpoint was modified to explicitly set  to  for all imports. The entire code block responsible for initiating and running automatic ping/speed tests immediately after import was removed. The import report structure was updated to no longer return a  upon successful import and to remove any testing-related messages, reinforcing that no automatic tests are started.
2.  **Frontend Changes ():** The component was streamlined to remove all UI elements related to selecting a testing mode. The  context was removed as automatic test initiation from this modal is no longer required. The  function was updated to ensure no testing mode is sent to the backend, and the logic for processing  and registering tests with  upon import completion was removed. The  was also updated to reflect the simplified process.

These changes ensure that all imported nodes are now treated as not_tested by default, and any testing must be initiated manually via the separate . Both frontend and backend changes were validated successfully by their respective testing agents.
