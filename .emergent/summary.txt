The trajectory details a significant evolution of the Connexa Admin Panel, moving from minor UI fixes to a major backend refactoring. Initially, the focus was on completing UI/UX tasks requested by the user, such as replacing a Service Control modal with direct Start/Stop Services buttons and fixing various actions. However, the user's focus shifted dramatically to a critical deficiency in the data import functionality.

The core of the work became a complete overhaul of the node data parser. The user provided detailed specifications for six different text formats, requiring a sophisticated, universal parsing logic. This new requirement extended beyond simple parsing to include data normalization (expanding country/state abbreviations) and a complex deduplication strategy based on IP, credentials, and timestamps.

The AI engineer systematically implemented these features by creating new backend modules for normalization and deduplication, completely rewriting the import API endpoint in , and adding a new endpoint to view parsing errors. Correspondingly, the frontend was updated in  and  to merge the Add Server and Import buttons, add a feature to view format errors, and display a detailed import summary. A critical bug preventing manual node creation was also identified via backend logs and resolved by fixing a missing type import. The work concluded with a full testing cycle that successfully validated all new features after resolving a temporary user login issue.

<product_requirements>
The primary goal is to build the Connexa v1.7 admin panel, a centralized tool for managing various network node connections (PPTP, SOCKS, OVPN, etc.).

**Initial MVP Implementation:**
The application was built with a React frontend and FastAPI/SQLite backend. It included core CRUD functionality for nodes, JWT-based authentication, basic data import/export, and initial service management features (start/stop PPTP/SOCKS).

**Recent Major Feature Overhaul (Data Parsing):**
The user identified the existing data parser as inadequate and requested a complete overhaul. The new requirements included:
1.  **Universal Parser:** Support for six distinct and complex text formats for importing node data.
2.  **Data Normalization:** Automatically convert country and state abbreviations (e.g., CA to California, GB to Great Britain) into their full names using a comprehensive database.
3.  **Advanced Deduplication:** Implement rules to handle duplicate entries based on IP, Login, and Password. If credentials differ for the same IP, the system must check the last update timestamp to decide whether to replace the old entry or queue it for verification.
4.  **Error Handling & UI:** Log any entries with incorrect formatting to a  file. Add a Format Error button in the UI to view this log. Merge the Add Server and Import buttons into a single dropdown for a cleaner interface. Display a detailed summary report after each import operation.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-stack Frameworks**: React.js (frontend) and FastAPI (backend).
- **Database**: SQLite with SQLAlchemy ORM.
- **Backend Logic**: Advanced text parsing using Python's string manipulation and regular expressions. Data normalization via dictionary lookups. Custom business logic for data deduplication.
- **API Design**: Creation of new RESTful endpoints (, ) to support the enhanced import functionality.
- **UI/UX**: Frontend development using ShadCN UI components, state management with React Hooks (), and implementation of modals and dynamic UI elements.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard monolith architecture with a distinct frontend and backend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The core of the FastAPI application, defining all API endpoints.
    -   **Changes**: The  endpoint was completely rewritten to orchestrate the new parsing, normalization, and deduplication logic from the new modules. A new endpoint, , was added to serve the error log file. A bug was fixed by adding a missing  import from the  module, which resolved an error during manual node creation.

-   ** (New File)**
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes data normalization logic.
    -   **Summary**: Contains dictionaries mapping country and US state abbreviations to their full names, ensuring data consistency in the database.

-   ** (New File)**
    -   **Importance**: Encapsulates the complex rules for handling duplicate node entries.
    -   **Summary**: Implements the logic to check for duplicates based on IP, login, and password, and manages the process of updating, queuing, or ignoring entries based on timestamps.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The main dashboard component that orchestrates all UI elements and actions.
    -   **Changes**: The separate Add Server and Import buttons were removed and replaced with a single Add/Import Server dropdown menu. A new Format Error button was added to the bulk actions section, along with a corresponding modal and the state management () needed to fetch and display the contents of the error log file.

-   ****
    -   **Importance**: The modal used for bulk importing of nodes.
    -   **Changes**: The  function was updated to call the new, more powerful backend import endpoint. The component now handles the detailed JSON response from the API to display a comprehensive summary of the import results (e.g., Added: 10, Duplicates: 5, Errors: 2). The placeholder text examples were updated to reflect the newly supported formats.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
- Full implementation of Redis RQ for asynchronous task queuing (e.g., node verification).
- Migration from SQLite to a production-grade PostgreSQL database.
- Integration of a GeoChecker service (e.g., MaxMind GeoIP2) for automatic data enrichment.
- Implementation of real-time status updates using Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSockets.
- Development of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and agent-mode scalability.
- Integration with Telegram Bot API for notifications.

<current_work>
The most recent work cycle focused on a comprehensive overhaul of the data import functionality in response to detailed user requirements. The previous, simplistic parser was replaced with a robust system capable of handling six different text formats for node data.

**Key achievements in this cycle:**
1.  **Backend Refactoring**: A new universal parser was developed in . Two new helper modules,  and , were created to handle the conversion of country/state codes and implement complex business logic for identifying and managing duplicate entries.
2.  **API Enhancement**: The import API endpoint () was updated to return a detailed JSON report summarizing the outcome of the import process (nodes added, duplicates found, errors encountered). A new endpoint () was created to allow users to view malformed entries.
3.  **UI/UX Improvements**: On the frontend (), the Add Server and Import buttons were consolidated into a single Add/Import Server dropdown. A Format Error button was added to the bulk actions, which opens a modal to display incorrectly formatted data. The  component was updated to display the detailed summary from the new API.
4.  **Bug Fixes**: A critical bug that caused an error when adding a node manually was diagnosed by inspecting backend logs and fixed by correcting a missing  type import in . A user-reported login issue was also diagnosed and resolved during the final testing phase.

The application has been thoroughly tested (both backend and frontend), and all newly implemented features are confirmed to be working as expected.

<optional_next_step>
The requested data parser overhaul and associated UI changes are complete and verified. The next step is to consult with the user to prioritize the next major feature from the list of pending tasks.
