The trajectory describes the transition of the Connexa Admin Panel development to a new AI engineer. Initially, the focus was on stability and performance fixes for ping/speed tests and a major Import Nodes feature implementation. The previous AI engineer successfully addressed backend SSE authentication, CORS, and frontend  integration, allowing initial progress display and import reports.

However, the user reported new issues: the import modal not auto-closing, the Import Nodes button hanging, and testing progress disappearing from  on re-opening. The current AI engineer diagnosed these as frontend integration and state management problems. Solutions involved refining  for automatic closure and adding a manual close button, and updating  to persist session states more robustly, prevent aggressive clearing, and correctly handle completed tests. All changes were validated via automated frontend testing.

The Connexa Admin Panel aims for real-time management of server import and testing with a responsive UI and clear feedback. Key features include:
1.  **Correct Progress Display**: Ensure real-time testing progress for import-initiated tests in the .
2.  **Import Report**: Display detailed import results (Added, Matched, Updated, Duplicate counts) immediately after import.
3.  **UI Stability**: Prevent UI hangs in the Import modal and ensure it functions smoothly without premature closing.
4.  **Backend Integrity**: Verify seamless data flow from the Import modal to the backend testing queue.
5.  **Load Optimization**: Maintain server stability during mass imports and testing.
6.  **Key Testing Parameters**: Adhere to optimized default testing parameters.

Recent user feedback highlighted two new critical issues that required immediate attention:
1.  The Import Nodes modal should automatically close after a successful import and test initiation, instead of hanging.
2.  Testing progress visible in the  should not disappear or collapse upon re-opening the modal, especially after repeated checks.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for backend APIs.
-   **React/Vite**: JavaScript library for frontend UI.
-   **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: For real-time progress updates.
-   **React Context API**: For global state management (e.g., ).
-   **Asyncio/Semaphores**: For concurrent operations in Python backend.
-   **CORS**: For secure cross-domain communication.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Central backend for API routes, business logic, and background tasks like node import and testing.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: The  endpoint was modified to remove authentication and add explicit CORS headers to the  for SSE.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Core logic for ping and speed tests.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: No direct changes in this trajectory, but its optimized functions are crucial for the accelerated testing performance.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Root component, defines routing and global context providers.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Wrapped the main  component with  to make the  available throughout the application.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main admin interface for node listing and actions.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Integrated  and . Added logic to display an active testing indicator (a red dot) on the Testing button if  returns a value greater than 0, reflecting ongoing import tests.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: React component for node testing, displaying real-time progress.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Integrated  context.  modified to check for active import sessions and automatically connect.  updated to mark sessions as  or  without aggressive clearing.  updated to clear state only if no active sessions.  no longer immediately clears . UI displays a badge (Из импорта) for import-initiated tests.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: React component for importing nodes, including SSE-based progress.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Integrated  context to register new import-initiated test sessions. Displays a detailed import report. The modal now automatically closes after a successful import and test initiation, and a Закрыть (Close) button was added.
-   **** (NEW FILE)
    -   **Importance**: Provides a global React context for managing active test sessions, allowing  and  to react to ongoing tests.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Created this new file, exporting  and  hook, managing  state.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Implement SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch**: Core business logic for provisioning SOCKS and OpenVPN services on managed servers, including backend API design and frontend integration.
-   **Future Automation with Auxiliary Servers**: Automating the testing process with helper servers.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully addressed new critical user-reported issues concerning the Import nodes functionality and . The user reported that the import modal would hang, not close automatically, and that testing progress would disappear from the  upon re-opening.

The AI engineer's work involved:
1.  ** Fixes**:
    *   Implemented automatic closure of the modal after successful import and test initiation, including a  for a brief display of the import report.
    *   Added a Закрыть (Close) button to allow manual closing of the modal.
2.  ** Fixes**:
    *   Revised the state management logic within  to prevent the aggressive clearing of  upon receiving messages or modal closure, ensuring that active or completed session data persists.
    *   Updated  dependencies and  to clear state only when there are no truly active testing sessions, allowing progress to remain visible upon re-opening the modal.
    *   Adjusted  to correctly mark sessions as  or  within the  without prematurely removing them from the UI.

These changes have been thoroughly tested by a frontend testing agent, confirming that the import process now closes automatically, the button no longer hangs, and the testing progress remains persistent in the  even after re-opening.
