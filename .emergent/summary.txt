The trajectory began with the previous AI optimizing the Connexa Admin Panel for UI responsiveness. When the current AI took over, the initial task was SOCKS/OVPN Service Launch, but this was immediately derailed by critical user reports: slow admin panel loading, ping test failures, and incorrect status reporting.

The AI systematically diagnosed and addressed these, initially fixing SQLite concurrency issues (, ) and implementing node cleanup functions in  and . Subsequent work focused heavily on refining the ping/speed testing logic: shifting from generic PPTP checks to protocol-specific port validation, introducing intelligent node skipping, and implementing a complex sticky status hierarchy (PING OK, SPEED OK, ONLINE).

Performance issues persisted, prompting the AI to implement parallel processing with semaphores, dynamic batch sizing, and adaptive timeouts for tests. Persistent login failures and admin panel unresponsiveness became critical, leading to fixes for CORS, session management, and the  startup logic. The most recent efforts centered on debugging recurring  and  in , particularly related to the  endpoint and an unclosed  block, which prevented the backend from starting, causing all login and testing functionalities to fail.

The Connexa Admin Panel is designed for real-time management of server import and testing, aiming to prevent UI freezes and provide clear feedback. Initial requirements included real-time progress via SSE, minimize functionality with  persistence, and backend batch processing. Key performance needs were responsive loading, accurate real-time reports, and prevention of duplicate config checks.

Recently, the user reported critical issues: slow admin panel loading, ping test failures, and incorrect status reporting. This led to a significant focus on optimizing test accuracy and performance. Specific requests evolved to:
1.  **Refined Ping/Speed Testing:** Implement protocol-specific port checks (e.g., PPTP: 1723, SOCKS: 1080, OVPN: 1194/443, SSH: 22) instead of a generic TCP check to port 1723.
2.  **Intelligent Test Filtering:** Avoid re-testing nodes with existing PING OK, SPEED OK, or ONLINE statuses for ping, and allow speed tests for all statuses except PING FAILED, including re-testing SPEED OK/ONLINE for speed.
3.  **Sticky Status Hierarchy:** Implement a logic where PING FAILED is only possible before the first successful PING or SPEED. PING OK becomes a permanent baseline after its first success. SPEED OK and ONLINE statuses, if degraded, should revert only to PING OK, never to PING FAILED.
4.  **Optimized Performance:** Address slow import/testing by implementing parallelism, dynamic batch sizing (120-200 nodes), adaptive ping timeouts (0.8s, 1.2s, 1.6s), and optimized speed test (512KB sample).
5.  **Centralized Progress:** Display all test progress exclusively in the Testing modal, with session recovery after page refresh (F5), and no progress display during import.
6.  **Admin Panel Stability:** Resolve critical login failures and panel unresponsiveness, which emerged during the testing optimization phase.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI was focused on resolving a critical issue: the admin panel was not accessible, specifically reporting Login failed. This stemmed from a cascading series of bugs that prevented the backend server from starting correctly or operating stably under load.

The primary root cause identified in the latest messages was a  and  within . Specifically, the  route was erroneously placed inside another handler, and an  statement was left incomplete without a corresponding code block. These syntax issues prevented the Uvicorn server from initializing properly, causing all API endpoints, including , to be unavailable or unstable.

Before this, significant work was done to optimize the ping and speed testing functionality. This included:
-   Implementing strict per-protocol port checks ().
-   Refining test filtering ( skips  nodes,  tests all except ).
-   Establishing a sticky status hierarchy ( as baseline).
-   Introducing parallelism ( with semaphores for 50 concurrent pings, 8 concurrent speed tests).
-   Optimizing ping attempts (exactly 3 with adaptive timeouts) and speed test data size.
-   Adding manual input fields for test parameters in .
-   Addressing  persistence for testing sessions and parameters.
-   Removing the Ping + Speed combined test option from both frontend modals and backend logic.
-   Disabling deduplication temporarily and implementing instant progress updates to ensure tests start visibly.

The login issues have overshadowed these improvements, as the panel is currently inaccessible. Fixes for CORS, session cookies (), and a robust admin user creation process (,  in login) were implemented to address previous login problems, but the underlying syntax error is preventing these from taking effect.

The immediate next step is to correctly fix the  and  in  that are preventing the backend from starting and then test the login.
