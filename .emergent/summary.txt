The trajectory details the hand-off to a new AI engineer, initially presenting an overview of the Connexa Admin Panel. The previous AI engineer successfully simplified the node import process by disabling automatic testing, defaulting nodes to not_tested, and removing testing UI elements from , ensuring manual testing through . This involved modifications in both  and . The current AI engineer's initial plan to implement SOCKS/OVPN services was superseded by a new explicit user request in Chat Message 7: to eliminate button duplication in the Admin Panel. Specifically, removing redundant service launch and testing buttons from  and their handlers. The AI engineer has completed an audit of the relevant frontend files (, ) to confirm these duplications and is now ready to present the findings to the user.

<product_requirements>
The Connexa Admin Panel provides real-time management of server import and testing with a responsive UI. Initial requirements included correct progress display, detailed import reports, UI stability, backend integrity, load optimization, and adherence to testing parameters. Prior fixes addressed import modal not auto-closing and testing progress disappearance.

The most recent completed feature simplified node import: automatic ping/speed tests upon import were removed; all new nodes default to not_tested status; testing-related options were removed from ; and all testing must now be manually initiated via .

The latest explicit user request is to eliminate button duplication in the Admin Panel:
1.  **Service Buttons:** Remove the Launch Services button and its handler () from , keeping only Start Services ().
2.  **Testing Buttons:** Remove Ping Test and Speed Test buttons and their handlers (, ) from , retaining only the Testing button which opens  for all testing options.
3.  Update the relevant comment section in .

-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for backend APIs.
-   **React/Vite**: JavaScript library for frontend UI.
-   **React Context API**: For global state management.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully implemented a significant simplification of the node import process. This involved:
1.  **Backend Changes ():** The  endpoint was modified to explicitly set  to  for all imports. The entire code block responsible for initiating and running automatic ping/speed tests after import was removed. The import report structure was updated to no longer return a  upon successful import, reinforcing that no automatic tests are started.
2.  **Frontend Changes ():** The component was streamlined to remove all UI elements related to selecting a testing mode. The  context was removed as automatic test initiation is no longer required. The  function was updated to ensure no testing mode is sent, and the logic for processing  and registering tests with  upon import completion was removed.

Most recently, the user provided a new, urgent task to eliminate button duplication within the . The AI engineer has completed an audit of  and  to identify and confirm the presence of redundant service launch buttons (Start Services vs. Launch Services) and testing buttons (Ping Test, Speed Test in Admin Panel vs. options in Testing Modal) and their associated handlers and endpoints. The audit's findings are ready to be presented to the user.
