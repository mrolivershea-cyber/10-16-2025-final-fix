The trajectory details the work of an AI engineer on an existing Connexa Admin Panel application. Initially, the engineer focused on integrating a SOCKS service, including UI, backend APIs, SOCKS5 server, monitoring, and database integration. This involved UI fixes in  and , and enhancing feedback for node selection. The engineer also implemented support for a new  node configuration format (Format 7) in  and updated .

Subsequently, the user reported issues with large file uploads causing the panel to freeze and login failures. The AI engineer diagnosed this as a synchronous processing problem in the backend. To address this, chunked upload functionality was implemented in  with new endpoints for chunk processing and progress tracking, and the  in the frontend was updated with client-side chunking and a progress bar. Backend testing confirmed the chunked import. Concurrently, the engineer resolved a bug where the SOCKS button in  was always enabled, incorrectly displaying selected nodes, by fixing its  logic and ensuring  state updates properly. Frontend testing of this fix was performed, and debug logs were removed. Finally, the engineer prepared a frontend test for chunked imports, correcting a CORS issue in the test HTML. The trajectory concludes with the AI engineer believing all requested tasks are completed and preparing this summary.

<product_requirements>
The Connexa Admin Panel requires a full SOCKS service feature. This includes a SOCKS button and Socks Online statistics on the , with node statuses (/) updating to  on SOCKS launch. The system needs a local SOCKS5 server with unique credentials, non-standard ports, and configurable traffic obfuscation in . A separate DB for SOCKS logs/statistics is needed, using existing  table fields. The  must offer masking, performance, security, and management settings, including viewing a report DB and a live proxy file (). Robust monitoring, reliability, and automated proxy file management are critical. Initial launch issues required improved UI/UX feedback. A recent explicit request was to support  format for node imports. The latest requirement is to handle large node configuration file uploads (e.g., 1.5MB text file) without freezing the application panel or causing login failures, ensuring smooth and responsive import operations.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for backend APIs.
-   **React/Vite**: JavaScript library for frontend UI, utilizing Context API for global state.
-   **SQLAlchemy**: ORM for database interactions (SQLite).
-   **SOCKS5 Protocol**: Core proxy service with obfuscation and monitoring.
-   **Asynchronous Processing**: Chunked file uploads for large data handling.
-   **Axios**: HTTP client for frontend API calls.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application uses a monorepo structure with a Python/FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend.



-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes backend API routes, business logic, SOCKS services, and node parsing.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   **Format 7 Support**: Implemented  to recognize Format 7 (IP:Login:Pass), added , and integrated it into the node parsing workflow.
        -   **Chunked Import**: Added  endpoint for receiving file chunks,  for processing data in batches, and  for progress tracking. The original  was modified to redirect large files to chunked processing.
        -   Ensured  import for database sessions.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Main administrative panel UI, displaying statistics and SOCKS service control.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   **SOCKS Button Logic**: Corrected the  attribute of the SOCKS button to  to accurately reflect whether nodes are selected, preventing inappropriate access.
        -   Added  for debugging  (later removed).
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: UI for SOCKS service configuration, management, and node status display.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   **Node Status Display**:  and  integration ensure detailed status for selected nodes is fetched and displayed.
        -   Added  for debugging  (later removed).
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Handles UI for importing node configurations.
    -   **Summary of Changes**:
        -   **Format 7 Example**: Updated to include an example for the Format 7 - Simple IP:Login:Pass structure.
        -   **Chunked Import UI**: Modified  to implement client-side file chunking, send chunks to the new backend endpoint, and poll for progress. Added UI elements for a progress bar (, , ) and a Cancel Upload button.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Documents testing protocols, user feedback, and previous agent communications, used for tracking task completion.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Continuously updated to reflect the status of implemented features, including chunked import and SOCKS selectedNodes state management.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Python script created for robust backend testing of the chunked import functionality.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Created to simulate large file uploads, perform login, initiate chunked import, and poll for progress. Corrected JSON login format during testing.
-   ****
    -   **Importance**: Simple HTML file created for preliminary frontend testing of the chunked import mechanism.
    -   **Summary of Changes**: Created to interact with the frontend's chunked import logic and later modified to correct a CORS-related URL issue.

<pending_tasks>
All explicit pending tasks from the initial summary related to the  state (investigating root cause, re-enabling disabled logic, ensuring nodes appear in UI) have been addressed and reported as fixed by the AI engineer in the trajectory. There are no currently *pending* tasks explicitly requested by the user that remain unaddressed in the provided trajectory.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer completed the implementation and initial verification of two key features:

1.  **Large File Upload (Chunked Import)**: The user requested support for importing large node configuration files without UI freezing. The AI engineer implemented a chunked upload mechanism:
    *   **Backend ()**: New endpoints (, ) and logic were added to handle file chunks, process data in batches, and track progress. Large files are now automatically redirected to this new chunked processing.
    *   **Frontend ()**: The import modal was updated to perform client-side chunking, send data in parts, and display a real-time progress bar.
    *   **Testing**: Backend testing using  and a custom Python script () confirmed successful chunked import and progress tracking, even with a user-provided 1.5MB file ().

2.  **SOCKS  State Management Fix**: An issue where the SOCKS button was inappropriately enabled and selected nodes weren't correctly displayed was addressed.
    *   **Frontend ()**: The  logic for the SOCKS button was corrected to properly reflect if any nodes were selected.
    *   **Frontend ()**: Updates were made to ensure the UI block for selected nodes correctly displays their detailed information.
    *   **Testing**: Frontend testing (though encountering an initial error) led the AI engineer to conclude the  state management works correctly.

The last action was correcting a CORS-related URL in a newly created  file, intended for frontend verification of the chunked import functionality. The AI engineer declared, Теперь все готово! Давайте резюмируем наши результаты:.
