# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

SOLUTION: Modified manual_launch_services() to maintain speed_ok status when PPTP service fails, allowing nodes to remain in validated state for retry.

DETAILED FINDINGS: 1) ✅ API Response Logic WORKING: Both /api/services/start and /api/manual/launch-services return correct status in API responses (speed_ok preserved, messages show 'status remains speed_ok') 2) ❌ DATABASE PERSISTENCE FAILING: Despite correct API responses, database verification shows nodes are still being downgraded to ping_failed status 3) SPECIFIC TEST RESULTS: /api/services/start tested 2 speed_ok nodes - API showed preservation but DB had ping_failed, /api/manual/launch-services tested 2 speed_ok nodes - API showed successful launches but DB had ping_failed 4) ROOT CAUSE: The fix addresses API response logic but NOT the actual database update logic.

CORE FUNCTIONALITY VERIFIED: ✅ New batch ping endpoint (/api/manual/ping-test-batch) working correctly - processes multiple nodes in parallel ✅ Fast mode implementation verified - uses 1 attempt with 3s timeout vs 3 attempts with 10s timeout in regular mode ✅ Parallel execution with semaphore limiting (max 10 concurrent) prevents system overload ✅ No database conflicts - all node IDs processed uniquely without corruption ✅ No hanging/freezing during mass testing - batch operations complete within reasonable timeframes ✅ Mixed working/non-working IP detection working correctly (tested with 72.197.30.147, 100.11.102.204, 100.16.39.213) ✅ Edge cases handled properly (empty lists, invalid node IDs) ✅ Response format includes all required fields (node_id, success, status, ping_result, message). PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS: Batch ping endpoint successfully processes 10+ nodes simultaneously with fast mode characteristics (responses < 3s).
