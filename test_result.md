# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ROOT CAUSE: Smart block splitting logic has bug when Format 4 (single-line colon-separated) appears immediately before Format 6 blocks (PPTP headers). The Format 4 line gets incorrectly grouped with Format 6 block instead of being processed as separate block. Individual format tests pass, but mixed format parsing fails. IMPACT: User reported only 1 config added from large text - this confirms the block splitting issue affects real-world usage."

Block splitting logic checks for multiple 'IP:' entries FIRST and splits entire block by 'IP:', destroying the Format 4 line.

    message: "❌ CRITICAL ISSUE DISCOVERED: Real user data test FAILED. Smart parser has critical bug in block splitting logic. PROBLEM: Only 9/10 nodes created from mixed format import. Missing node: 70.171.218.52:admin:admin:US:Arizona:85001 (Format 4). ROOT CAUSE: When Format 4 (single-line colon-separated) appears immediately before Format 6 blocks (PPTP headers), the block splitting logic incorrectly groups the Format 4 line with the Format 6 block instead of processing it as a separate block. EVIDENCE: Individual format tests pass, but mixed format parsing fails. This explains user's report of only 1 config being added from large mixed-format text. IMPACT: Critical production issue affecting real-world usage. RECOMMENDATION: Fix smart block splitting logic to properly separate single-line formats from multi-line formats when they appear consecutively."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "🚨 CRITICAL RE-TEST COMPLETED: Confirmed Format 4 block splitting bug persists. DETAILED ANALYSIS: Used debug parser to trace exact issue. In parse_nodes_text() function, Pre-block 4 contains Format 4 line '70.171.218.52:admin:admin:US:Arizona:85001' followed by Format 6 blocks containing 'IP:' keywords. Current logic checks for multiple 'IP:' entries FIRST and splits entire block by 'IP:', which destroys the Format 4 line. SPECIFIC FIX REQUIRED: In server.py lines 458-477, reorder block splitting logic to check for single-line formats (Format 2,3,4) BEFORE checking for multiple Format 1/6 entries. This will extract Format 4 line first, then process remaining Format 6 blocks separately. PRIORITY: CRITICAL - affects real user data parsing, only 9/10 nodes created instead of expected 10."

    message: "🎉 CRITICAL ISSUE RESOLVED - FORMAT 4 BLOCK SPLITTING FIXED: Comprehensive testing confirms the Format 4 block splitting issue has been successfully resolved. VERIFIED RESULTS: All 10 nodes now created correctly from the exact review request data, including the critical Format 4 node (70.171.218.52:admin:admin:US:Arizona:85001). DETAILED VERIFICATION: Tested with exact user data containing mixed formats - all nodes created with correct field parsing: Format 1 (2 nodes with key-value pairs), Format 2 (2 nodes with correct IP Login Password State order), Format 3 (2 nodes with dash/pipe format), Format 4 (1 node - CRITICAL FIX CONFIRMED), Format 6 (3 nodes with PPTP headers). ADDITIONAL CONFIRMATIONS: Headers properly filtered (@mentions, channel names), state normalization working (CA→California, NJ→New Jersey), extra text removal working (a_reg_107), smart block splitting now correctly handles single-line formats before multi-line formats. The two-pass algorithm implementation successfully separates Format 4 lines from Format 6 blocks. Parser is production-ready and handles real-world mixed format data correctly. Task moved from stuck_tasks to completed."
