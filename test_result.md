# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

user_problem_statement: "Critical Status Assignment Bug and Admin Panel Enhancement: User imported 2,336 PPTP configurations which incorrectly received 'online' status instead of 'not_tested'. The /api/stats endpoint shows 'Not Tested: 2' when it should show 2,332. Need to: 1) Fix status assignment logic for new imports, 2) Implement manual testing workflow (ping → speed → SOCKS+OVPN service launch), 3) Add background monitoring for online nodes every 5 minutes, 4) Add last_update field for offline status tracking."

Button functionality working (clipboard permission denied in test environment is expected). Format confirmed to be IP:Login:Password as requested. Button positioned correctly in password column alongside eye/show password button."

No EditableCell functionality found in location fields (no input elements appear on click). Fields are properly read-only as requested. Second row structure correctly displays location data without edit capability."

    message: "CRITICAL BUG INVESTIGATION COMPLETE: Successfully reproduced the exact user problem. Database analysis revealed 2,336 nodes with 2,332 incorrectly having 'online' status instead of 'not_tested'. Root cause identified: import process or test data creation bypassed default status assignment. Need to implement comprehensive fix: 1) Ensure all new imports default to 'not_tested', 2) Fix /api/stats synchronization issue, 3) Implement manual admin workflow (ping → speed → service launch), 4) Add background monitoring system for online nodes only."

    message: "STARTING IMPLEMENTATION: Phase 1 - Fix critical status assignment bugs in import logic and verify /api/stats accuracy. Phase 2 - Add last_update field to Node model for offline tracking. Phase 3 - Implement manual testing workflow with admin controls. Phase 4 - Create background monitoring system (5-minute checks, 30-minute initial period for new online nodes)."
